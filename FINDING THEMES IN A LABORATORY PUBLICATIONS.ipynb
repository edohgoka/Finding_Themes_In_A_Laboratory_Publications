In order to fully exploit its potential, the process requires a specific and demanding environment, penalizing its industrial deployment. In this context, an alternative route is proposed. In the proposed process, semi-solid zones at the heart of the material coexist with surrounding solid zones within the part. The outcome is an optimized process where the benefits of thixoforging are reached at a significant extent within the classical process framework of hot forging. The paper investigates this proposal up to a full-scale proof-of concept in an industrial setting.                    ',\n",

Both implicit and explicit time integration schemes are reviewed and presented in algorithmic form. The incremental kinematics are also treated, so that the proposed algorithms can be used stand-alone, outside a finite element code, or they can serve to implement non-classical incremental kinematics. Full algorithms are provided, along with examples of application to non-monotonic loading for a mild steel and a dual phase steel.                    ',\n",

L’implantation est réalisée sous forme d’une routine utilisateur (UMAT) dans Abaqus/std via un schéma d’intégration explicite de type Runge-Kutta. Enfin, l’efficacité de la modélisation utilisée, pour la prédire les limites de formage des tôles est explorée.                    ',\n",

       " '\\nRésumé : Abrupt strain path changes without elastic unloading have been used in the literature to investigate the yield surface of sheet metals, both experimentally and theoretically. Such pioneering studies emphasized an apparent non-normality of the plastic strain rate tensor with respect to the trace of the yield surface in stress space, following such a strain-path change. They inspired numerous subsequent developments of plasticity models including non-associated flow rules. In this paper, this type of abrupt strain-path changes is investigated using state-of-the-art plasticity models. The aim is to emphasize the respective contributions of elasticity, isotropic-kinematic hardening, and rate sensitivity, to the apparent violation of the normality condition. The results show that these classical ingredients of plasticity models significantly contribute to the apparent vertex and loss of normality. These effects are quantified for typical sheet metals subject to biaxial-to-shear orthogonal strain path change.                    ',\n",

Hardening identification of large strains is a trade-off between cost, standardization and the ability to represent the experiment, but there are no standard procedures to date. In this proposed approach, large strains (larger than 1) are reached using an industrial wire drawing process, and measured data for identification are obtained from standard tensile tests. Fast semi-analytical post-processing was possible despite the significant process-inherited strain heterogeneity. The parameters of state-of-the-art hardening models were identified, and the robustness was demonstrated to reach far beyond the strain level attained in the experiments. As a consequence, accurate and robust large strain hardening modelling was achieved from standard (tensile test) acquisition by using industrial wire drawing pre-strains.                    ',\n",

Weight reduction of structures seems to be an interesting way to satisfy these requirements. This can be achieved either by using new materials, such as high strength steels or by adopting appropriate dimensioning methods to predict the occurrence of strain localization. Forming Limit Diagram (FLD) is a concept widely used to characterize the formability of thin metal sheets. Analytical determination of FLDs is usually based on the use of localization criteria. Some of the existing material instability criteria are for example based on empirical observations, on the maximum load principle [1-3], on the existence of an initial defect in the sheet [4], on a perturbation method [5] or on bifurcation analysis [6]. Although numerous criteria have been developed, they all have advantages but also drawbacks and limitations. Their confrontation on a wide range of materials is still insufficiently developed to compare their respective capability of accurately predicting FLDs for new materials. Adaptations of some criteria to advanced constitutive laws are also made necessary by the use of new high strength materials. The aim of this paper is to give a general formulation of some localization criteria allowing the comparison of the predicted FLDs for a wide range of materials. An implementation of these criteria coupled with different phenomenological constitutive laws is presented and compared for different materials including an aluminium alloy, a brass and a dual phase steel.

In order to improve the prediction of the formability limit of sheets under forming it is important to consider constitutive models that take into account the degradation of material properties due to large strain localization. For this purpose, an elastic-plastic model has been coupled with the classical damage model of Lemaitre and Chaboche [2,3]. Two hardening models are considered in an attempt to more accurately reproduce the work-hardening phenomenon at large strains. The first one represents the classical cyclic hardening model of Chaboche-Marquis [3,4] while the second corresponds to the so-called dislocation-based microstructural model of Teodosiu and Hu [5,6]. These two models are able to reproduce some transient hardening phenomena at strain path changes - with a better description obtained with the microstructural model. The coupling with damage is carried out within the framework of continuum damage mechanics thanks to the introduction of a scalar variable describing the degradation of the elastic proprieties and consequently softening behaviour when damage occurs. The coupled elastic-plastic damage model is implemented into the Abaqus software using an implicit integration scheme. The resulting code is used for the prediction of forming limit diagrams.                    ',\n",

While some specific applications require very accurate models, in many common situations simpler (isotropic hardening) models may be sufficient. In these conditions, investigation of the impact of hardening models requires well defined test configurations and accurate measurements to generate the reference data. Specific draw-bend tests have been especially conceived for this purpose. In this work, such a draw-bending experimental device has been designed, for use on a biaxial tension machine. Three different steel sheets have been tested (one mild steel sheet and two HSS sheets) with thicknesses between 0.8 and 2 mm. Up to three different back-force levels were used for the tests. Wall curvatures and springback angles were measured. Finite element simulations of the tests were performed. A parameter sensitivity analysis has been carried out in order to determine the numerical parameters ensuring accurate springback results. The tests were simulated using an isotropic hardening model and a combined isotropic-kinematic hardening model.

The main theoretical models can be summarized as: the maximum force principle, according to which necking is associated with the maximum load in a uniaxial tensile test; Marciniak-Kuczyński (M-K) two-zone analysis, based on an initial thickness defect in the sheet; bifurcation theory, predicting diffuse necking with general bifurcation criterion or localized modes corresponding to loss of ellipticity; and more recently, linear stability analysis by means of linearization of perturbed equilibrium equations. Considering this variety of models, a careful comparison of numerical Forming Limit Diagrams (FLDs) along with in-depth understanding of their theoretical foundations is required to help select relevant localization criteria. In this paper, the theoretical bases of M-K and Rice's criteria are first reviewed, which are then applied to steels modeled by elasto-plastic constitutive equations coupled with damage. It is shown that the FLDs obtained with the M-K model tend to those yielded by Rice's criterion in the limit of vanishing initial imperfections.                    \",\n",

In this paper, for the first time it is shown that strain rate potentials which are exact conjugate of the stress-based potentials can be instead used to model the dilatational response of porous polycrystals. A new integration algorithm is also developed. It is to be noted that a strain-rate based formulation is most appropriate when the plastic flow of the matrix is described by a criterion that involves dependence on all stress invariants. In such cases, although a strain-rate potential is known, the stress-based potential cannot be obtained explicitly. While the proposed framework based on strain-rate potentials is general, for comparison purposes in this work we present an illustration of the approach for the case of a porous solid with von Mises matrix containing randomly distributed spherical cavities. Comparison between simulations using the strain-rate based approach and the classical stress-based Gurson’s criterion in uniaxial tension is presented. These results show that the model based on a strain-rate potential predicts the dilatational response with the same level of accuracy.                    ',\n",

Classical forming limit diagrams are known not to apply properly to the cut edges. However, with mild steels the sheet edges usually behave better than the Forming Limit Diagram predictions, so this phenomenon has not been given sufficient attention. In contrast, for Advanced High Strength Steels the cut edges exhibit reduced formability as compared to the plain sheet; this effect is very sensitive to the quality of the cutting process. The current investigation is aimed to evaluate the ability of available damage models to predict this effect on sample applications. The Gurson-Tvergaard-Needleman model is used and the material parameters for a Dual Phase steel are considered [1].

The geometrical distribution and typical values for these two initial fields are devised based on literature. Numerical simulations of flat notched tensile tests are used within the FE code Abaqus/Explicit to illustrate the impact of the initial fields on the moment and the location of the failure initiation.

Material parameters are determined for several anisotropic, fcc and bcc sheet metals, and the gain in accuracy of the new models is demonstrated. For the considered materials, increasing the number of linear transformations leads to a systematic improvement of the accuracy, up to a number of five linear transformations. The proposed model fits very closely the predictions of the micromechanical model in the whole space of plastic strain-rate directions.

More and more flexible models imply higher and higher costs in terms of parameter identification, computer implementation and simulation time, and robust comparison is often compromised by the inconsistent predictions of advanced models under monotonic loading.

This objective was reached without any drawback other than the addition of the corresponding equations.

In order to improve numerical simulation predictions of sheet parts forming, physically-based constitutive models are often required. The main objective of this paper is to analyze the strain localization phenomenon during the plastic deformation of sheet metals in the context of such advanced constitutive models. Most often, an accurate prediction of localization requires damage to be considered in the finite element simulation. For this purpose,\\nan advanced, anisotropic elastic-plastic model, formulated within the large strain framework and taking strain-path changes into account, has been coupled with an isotropic damage model. This coupling is carried out within the framework of continuum damage mechanics.\\nIn order to detect the strain localization during sheet metal forming, Rice’s localization\\ncriterion has been considered, thus predicting the limit strains at the occurrence of shear bands as well as their orientation. The coupled elastic-plastic-damage model has been implemented in Abaqus/Implicit. The application of the model to the prediction of Forming Limit Diagrams (FLDs) provided results that are consistent with the literature and emphasized the impact of the hardening model on the strain-path dependency of the FLD. The fully threedimensional formulation adopted in the numerical development allowed for some new results – e.g. the out-of-plane orientation of the normal to the localization band, as well as more realistic values for its in-plane orientation.

On se propose ici d’étudier la localisation des déformations durant la mise en forme de tôles d’acier à haute résistance. Plus précisément, on aborde la prédiction des courbes limites de formage (CLF) de ces tôles en trajets directs et séquentiels. \\nGénéralement, une bonne prédiction de la localisation des déformations nécessite la prise en compte de l’endommagement dans le modèle de comportement. Ainsi, un modèle de comportement élasto-plastique couplé à un modèle d’endommagement a été considéré. Le couplage est réalisé dans le cadre de l’approche de la mécanique de l’endommagement continu (Lemaitre et Chaboche, 1986). L’écrouissage du matériau est pris en compte en introduisant le modèle microstructural de Teodosiu et Hu (1998). Ce modèle permet de tenir compte des phénomènes de changement de trajets de déformation induits lors de la mise en forme des tôles. Dans le but de définir des points limites associés à la localisation de la déformation et qui représenteront les points de la CLF, un critère de localisation est également introduit (critère de Rice, 1976). Le modèle de comportement résultant, combiné au critère de localisation, a été implanté dans le code de calcul par éléments finis Abaqus/Standard en utilisant la routine UMAT pour le comportement et la routine UVARM pour le critère.\\nComme application, des simulations de tests rhéologiques avec des chargements directs et séquentiels ont été réalisées afin de montrer simultanément les phénomènes de transition liés au changement de trajets de déformation et ceux relatifs à l’endommagement.

It is based on recent results of X-ray tomography in-situ tensile tests and subsequent one-dimensional metallurgical void nucleation models proposed in [C. Landron et al., Scripta Materialia 63 (2010) 973–976]. A macroscopic void nucleation law for DP steels is proposed, covering a wide range of stress triaxialities. The respective effects of nucleation, growth and coalescence are clearly separated.

       " '\\nAbstract : Sheet metal forming processes involve multi-axial strain paths. For the numerical simulation of such processes, an appropriate constitutive model that properly describes material behavior at large strain is required. For accurate and time-effective simulations, it is crucial to use plasticity models based on physics, as material macroscopic behavior is closely related to the evolution of the associated microstructures. Accordingly, a large strain work-hardening phenomenological model that incorporates the intragranular microstructure evolution through a dislocation density approach is proposed. The model is defined by a yield criterion and hardening laws that are all grain-size dependent. The classical Hill criterion in which grain-size dependency was introduced is proposed. Hardening laws are given by a combination of kinematic and isotropic contributions that respectively take into account the evolution with strain of cell blocks formed by geometrically necessary boundaries (GNBs) and individual dislocation cells delineated by incidental dislocation boundaries within cell blocks (IDBs). On the one hand, IDBs evolution contribution is described by a modified Rauch et al. isotropic model, which is able to describe work-hardening stagnation and work-softening. On the other hand, GNBs evolution contribution is described by a grain-size dependent tensorial back-stress expression proposed by Aouafi et al. [2007] to describe the plastic anisotropy and Bauschinger effect. Moreover, the proposed model aims to accurately predict steel behavior through an innovative approach by only changing few “simply measurable” microstructure data (e.g. chemical composition, grain size…). The predictive capabilities of the model are assessed for interstitial free (IF) and dual phase (DP) steels with grain sizes varying respectively in the 8-40 µm and 1-10 µm value range. Different loading paths are analyzed, namely the uniaxial tensile test, reversal simple shear and orthogonal tests.                    ',\n",
       " '\\nAbstract : This paper investigates a recently developed elasto-plastic constitutive model. For this purpose, the model was implemented in a commercial finite element code and was used to simulate the cross-die deep drawing test. Deep drawing experiments and numerical simulations were conducted for five interstitial-free steels and seven dual-phase steels, each of them having a different thickness and strength. The main interest of the adopted model is a very efficient parameter identification procedure, due to the physical background of the model and the physical significance of some of its parameters and state variables. Indeed, the dislocation density, grain size, and martensite volume fraction explicitly enter the model’s formulation, although the overall approach is macroscopic. For the dual-phase steels, only the chemical composition and the average grain sizes were measured for the martensite and ferrite grains, as well as the martensite volume fraction. The mild steels required three additional tensile tests along three directions, in order to describe the plastic anisotropy. Information concerning the transient mechanical behavior after strain-path changes (reverse and orthogonal) was not collected for each material, but for only one material of each family of steels (IF, DP), based on previous works available in the literature. This minimalistic experimental base was used to feed the numerical simulations for the twelve materials that were confronted to deep drawing experiments in terms of thickness distributions. The results suggested that the accuracy of the numerical simulations is very satisfactory in spite of the scarce experimental input data. Additional investigations indicated that the modeling of the transient behavior due to strain-path changes may have a significant impact on the simulation results, and that the adopted approach provides a simple and efficient alternative in this regard.

This type of constitutive models is suitable for application in forming simulations, particularly for finite element analysis and design codes based on rigid plasticity. Convex formulations were proposed to describe the anisotropic behavior of materials for a full 3-D plastic strain rate state (5 independent components for incompressible plasticity). The 4th order tensors containing the plastic anisotropy coefficients for orthotropic symmetry were specified. The method recommended for the determination of the coefficients using experimental mechanical data for sheet materials was discussed. The formulations were shown to be suitable for the constitutive modeling of FCC and BCC cubic materials. Moreover, these proposed strain rate potentials, called Srp2004-18p and Srp2006-18p, led to a description of plastic anisotropy, which was similar to that provided by a generalized stress potential proposed recently, Yld2004-18p.

In this investigation, the predictions of state-of-the-art crystal plasticity (CP) and phenomenological models are compared in the framework of industrial bending-dominated forming processes. Sheet copper alloys 0.1mm-thick are considered, with more than 20 grains through the thickness. Consequently, both model approaches are valid on theoretical ground. The phenomenological models’ performance was conditioned by the experimental database used for parameter identification. The CP approach was more robust with respect to parameter identification, while allowing for a less flexible description of kinematic hardening, at the cost of finer mesh and specific grain-meshing strategies. The conditions for accurate springback predictions with CP-based models are investigated, in an attempt to bring these models at the robustness level required for industrial application.

       " \"\\nAbstract : With a view to environmental, economic and safety concerns, car manufacturers need to design lighter and safer vehicles in ever shorter development times. In recent years, High Strength Steels (HSS) like Interstitial Free (IF) steels which have higher ratios of yield strength to elastic modulus, are increasingly used for sheet metal parts in automotive industry to meet the demands. Moreover, the application of sheet metal forming simulations has proven to be beneficial to reduce tool costs in the design stage and to optimize current processes. The Finite Element Method (FEM) is quite successful to simulate metal forming processes but accuracy largely depends on the quality of the material properties provided as input to the material model. Common phenomenological models roughly consist in the fitting of functions on experimental results and do not provide any predictive character for different metals from the same grade. Therefore, the use of accurate plasticity models based on physics would increase predictive capability, reduce parameter identification cost and allow for robust and time-effective finite element simulations. For this purpose, a 3D physically based model at large strain with dislocation density evolution approach was presented in IDDRG2009 by the authors [1]. This model allows the description of work-hardening's behavior for different loading paths (i.e. uni-axial tensile, simple shear and Bauschinger tests) taking into account several data from microstructure (i.e. grain size, texture, etc...). The originality of this model consists in the introduction of microstructure data in a classical phenomenological model in order to achieve work-hardening's predictive character for different metals from the same grade. Indeed, thanks to a microstructure parameter set for an Interstitial Free steel, it is possible to describe work-hardening behavior for different loading paths of other IF steels by only changing the mean grain size and the chemical composition. During sheet metal forming processes local material points may experience multi-axial and multi-path loadings. Before simulating actual industrial parts, automotive manufacturers use validation tools - e.g. the Cross-Die stamping test. Such typical stamping tests enable the evaluation of a complex distribution of strains. The work described is an implementation [2] of a 3D dislocation based model in ABAQUS/Explicit and its validation on a Finite Element (FE) Cross-Die model. In order to assess the performance and relevance of the 3D dislocation based model in the simulation of industrial forming applications, the results of thinning profiles predicted along several directions and the strain distribution were obtained and compared with experimental results for IF steels with grain sizes varying in the 8-22 μm value range.                    \",\n",

However, these studies usually simplify a robot torso as one link, which is different from a human torsos containing 33 vertebrae. In this paper, therefore, we study the optimal walking of a 6-link planar biped with a segmented torso derived from its 5-link counterpart while ensuring that two models are equivalent when the additional torso joint is locked. For the walking, we suppose that each step is composed of a single support phase and an instantaneous double support phase, and two phases are connected by a plastic impact mapping. In addition, the controlled outputs named symmetry outputs capable of generating exponentially stable orbits using hybrid zero dynamics, are adopted to improve physical interpretation. The desired outputs are parameterized by B´ezier functions, with 5-link robot having 16 parameters to optimizeand 6-link robot having 19 parameters. According to our energy criterion, the segmented torso structure may reduce energy consumption up to 8% in bipedal walking, and the maximum energy saving is achieved at high walking speeds, while leaving the criteria at low walking speeds remain similar for both robots.

Due to the kinematic complexity of human joints, their movements are notoriously difficult to be reproduced by a mechanism. The human knees allow movements including rolling and sliding, and therefore the design of new bioinspired knees is of utmost importance for the reproduction of anthropomorphic walking in the sagittal plane. In this article, the kinematic characteristics of knees were analyzed and a mechanical solution for reproducing them is proposed. The geometrical, kinematic and dynamic models are built together with an impact model for a biped robot with the new knee kinematic.

The trajectories of walking are approximated by mathematical functions for a gait composed of single support phases with impacts. Energy criteria allow comparing the robot provided with the new rolling knee mechanism and a robot equipped with revolute knee joints. The results of the optimizations show that the rolling knee brings a decrease of the sthenic criterion. The comparisons of torques are also observed to show the difference of energy distribution between the actuators.

However, in most industrial robots, the real positions and velocities of each link are not measured, so in this study, an observer is proposed to reconstruct the real angular positions and velocities of links by using the measured angular positions and the velocities of actuators. A simulation by Matlab/Simulink has been carried out with a 2 axis Robot during its machining processes: the proposed observer showed great performances in estimating the state of the robot (position and velocity).

It improves not only mechanical and surface properties of workpiece but the integration of vibration in metal forming process has also been helpful in the reduction of forming force required for the process. Majority of the work done before in this field is related to single vibration source vibration and its application in metal forming process. The aim of this work is to develop a mathematical model for multi vibration assisted forging process. The combination of multi mechanical vibrations generates a complicated movement of lower die without deforming it. This developed mathematical model proves that movement is basically in the form of progressive wave in the lower die thus resulting local surface movement. In reality this movement can be generated by the vibration given by multi piezoelectric actuators. Based on this mathematical model, simulations using finite element software Forge2011® have been performed to observe the presence of progressive wave in the workpiece. The simulations’ kinematics confirms the existence of progressive wave in the workpiece. Simulation results demonstrate the effect of progressive wave to reduce the forging force, reduction of friction on the lower surface of die and hence improvement the forging process. Based on the developed mathematical model and simulation results, design proposition for multi vibration assisted forging process has been presented in this work.                    ',\n",

In order to explore those results, a coupling model has been developed to provide a design tool in a mechatronic frame which consists of an analytical model of the forging process based on simplified visco-plastic laws and a state space model of the piezoelectric actuator based on a finite element approach [1]. The coupling model can be used to analyse the important parameters of the whole process in order to optimize the forging process design using mechanical vibrations or to control the process if necessary. A finite element simulation of forging process using mechanical vibration based on finite element software Forge2008® is also presented in this study. The results obtained by experiment, finite element simulation and simulation using the model above are compared in the case of simple upsetting, with good agreement. Moreover, it can be concluded that high frequencies are not required to observe this phenomenon.

       " '\\nAbstract : Vibration assisted forming is one of the most recent and beneficial technique used to improve forming process. Effects of vibration on metal forming processes can be attributed to two causes. First, the volume effect links lowering of yield stress with the influence of vibration on the dislocation movement. Second, the surface effect explains lowering of the effective coefficient of friction by periodic reduction contact area. This work is related to vibration assisted forming process in viscoplastic domain. Impact of change in vibration waveform has been analyzed. For this purpose, two analytical models have been developed for two different types of vibration waveforms (sinusoidal and triangular). These models were developed on the basis of Slice method that is used to find out the required forming force for the process. Final relationships show that application of triangular waveform in forming process is more beneficial as compare to sinusoidal vibrations in terms of reduced forming force. Finite Element Method (FEM) based simulations were performed using Forge2008®and these confirmed the results of analytical models. The ratio of vibration speed to upper die speed is a critical factor in the reduction of the forming force.                    ',\n",

       " '\\nAbstract : Microsatellites are polymorphic short tandem repeats of 1–6 nucleotides ubiquitously present in the genome that are extensively used in living organisms as genetic markers and in oncology to detect microsatellite instability (MSI). While the standard analysis method of microsatellites is based on PCR followed by capillary electrophoresis, it generates undesirable frameshift products known as ‘stutter peaks’ caused by the polymerase slippage that can greatly complicate the analysis and interpretation of the data. Here we present an easy multiplexable approach replacing PCR that is based on low temperature isothermal amplification using recombinase polymerase amplification (LT-RPA) that drastically reduces and sometimes completely abolishes the formation of stutter artifacts, thus greatly simplifying the calling of the alleles. Using HT17, a mononucleotide DNA repeat that was previously proposed as an optimal marker to detect MSI in tumor DNA, we showed that LT-RPA improves the limit of detection of MSI compared to PCR up to four times, notably for small deletions, and simplifies the identification of the mutant alleles. It was successfully applied to clinical colorectal cancer samples and enabled detection of MSI. This easy-to-handle, rapid and cost-effective approach may deeply improve the analysis of microsatellites in several biological and clinical applications.                    ',\n",

Our findings contrast with two hepatocellular adenoma cases related to FAP, for which a biallelic inactivation of the APC gene was previously described.

Such pioneering studies emphasized an apparent non-normality of the plastic strain rate tensor with respect to the trace of the yield surface in stress space, following such a strain-path change. They inspired numerous subsequent developments of plasticity models including non-associated flow rules. In this paper, this type of abrupt strain-path changes is investigated using state-of-the-art plasticity models. The aim is to emphasize the respective contributions of elasticity, isotropic-kinematic hardening, and rate sensitivity, to the apparent violation of the normality condition. The results show that these classical ingredients of plasticity models significantly contribute to the apparent vertex and loss of normality.

Forming Limit Diagram (FLD) is a concept widely used to characterize the formability of thin metal sheets. Analytical determination of FLDs is usually based on the use of localization criteria. Some of the existing material instability criteria are for example based on empirical observations, on the maximum load principle [1-3], on the existence of an initial defect in the sheet [4], on a perturbation method [5] or on bifurcation analysis [6]. Although numerous criteria have been developed, they all have advantages but also drawbacks and limitations. Their confrontation on a wide range of materials is still insufficiently developed to compare their respective capability of accurately predicting FLDs for new materials. Adaptations of some criteria to advanced constitutive laws are also made necessary by the use of new high strength materials. The aim of this paper is to give a general formulation of some localization criteria allowing the comparison of the predicted FLDs for a wide range of materials. An implementation of these criteria coupled with different phenomenological constitutive laws is presented and compared for different materials including an aluminium alloy, a brass and a dual phase steel.

       " '\\nAbstract : This work aims to study the strain localization in different sheet metal forming processesby the finite element method using advanced behaviour models. In order to improve the prediction of the formability limit of sheets under forming it is important to consider constitutive models that take into account the degradation of material properties due to large strain localization. For this purpose, an elastic-plastic model has been coupled with the classical damage model of Lemaitre and Chaboche [2,3]. Two hardening models are considered in an attempt to more accurately reproduce the work-hardening phenomenon at large strains. The first one represents the classical cyclic hardening model of Chaboche-Marquis [3,4] while the second corresponds to the so-called dislocation-based microstructural model of Teodosiu and Hu [5,6]. These two models are able to reproduce some transient hardening phenomena at strain path changes - with a better description obtained with the microstructural model. The coupling with damage is carried out within the framework of continuum damage mechanics thanks to the introduction of a scalar variable describing the degradation of the elastic proprieties and consequently softening behaviour when damage occurs. The coupled elastic-plastic damage model is implemented into the Abaqus software using an implicit integration scheme. The resulting code is used for the prediction of forming limit diagrams.                    ',\n",

To improve the prediction of some undesirable phenomena, such as springback, physical behavior models should be considered. This paper investigates springback behavior predicted by advanced elastoplastic hardening models which combine isotropic and kinematic hardening and take strain-path changes into account. A dislocation-based microstructural hardening model formulated from physical observations and the more classical cyclic model of Chaboche have been considered in this work. Numerical implementation was carried out in the ABAQUS software using a return mapping algorithm with a combined backward Euler and semi-analytical integration scheme of the constitutive equations. The capability of each model to reproduce transient hardening phenomena at abrupt strain-path changes has been shown via simulations of sequential rheological tests. A springback analysis of strip drawing tests was performed in order to emphasize the impact of several influential parameters, namely: process, numerical and behavior parameters. The effect of the two hardening models with respect to the process parameters has been specifically highlighted.                    ',\n",

While some specific applications require very accurate models, in many common situations simpler (isotropic hardening) models may be sufficient. In these conditions, investigation of the impact of hardening models requires well defined test configurations and accurate measurements to generate the reference data. Specific draw-bend tests have been especially conceived for this purpose. In this work, such a draw-bending experimental device has been designed, for use on a biaxial tension machine. Three different steel sheets have been tested (one mild steel sheet and two HSS sheets) with thicknesses between 0.8 and 2 mm. Up to three different back-force levels were used for the tests. Wall curvatures and springback angles were measured. Finite element simulations of the tests were performed. A parameter sensitivity analysis has been carried out in order to determine the numerical parameters ensuring accurate springback results. The tests were simulated using an isotropic hardening model and a combined isotropic-kinematic hardening model. The impact of the hardening model is explored for the various test configurations and conclusions are drawn concerning their relative importance.                    ',\n",

This hexahedral linear element has an arbitrary number of integration points distributed along a single line, defining the \"thickness\" direction; and to control the hourglass modes inherent to this reduced integration, a physical stabilization technique is used. In addition, the assumed strain method is adopted for the elimination of locking. The implementation of the element in Abaqus/Standard via the UEL user subroutine has been assessed through a variety of benchmark problems involving geometric non-linearities, anisotropic plasticity, large deformation and contact. Initially designed for the efficient simulation of elastic-plastic thin structures, the SHB8PS exhibits interesting potentialities for sheet metal forming applications - both in terms of efficiency and accuracy.

       " \"\\nRésumé : Because prevention of forming defects has become one of the major industrial challenges, various experimental and theoretical approaches have been developed to predict sheet metal formability. The main theoretical models can be summarized as: the maximum force principle, according to which necking is associated with the maximum load in a uniaxial tensile test; Marciniak-Kuczyński (M-K) two-zone analysis, based on an initial thickness defect in the sheet; bifurcation theory, predicting diffuse necking with general bifurcation criterion or localized modes corresponding to loss of ellipticity; and more recently, linear stability analysis by means of linearization of perturbed equilibrium equations. Considering this variety of models, a careful comparison of numerical Forming Limit Diagrams (FLDs) along with in-depth understanding of their theoretical foundations is required to help select relevant localization criteria. In this paper, the theoretical bases of M-K and Rice's criteria are first reviewed, which are then applied to steels modeled by elasto-plastic constitutive equations coupled with damage. It is shown that the FLDs obtained with the M-K model tend to those yielded by Rice's criterion in the limit of vanishing initial imperfections.                    \",\n",

In this paper, for the first time it is shown that strain rate potentials which are exact conjugate of the stress-based potentials can be instead used to model the dilatational response of porous polycrystals. A new integration algorithm is also developed. It is to be noted that a strain-rate based formulation is most appropriate when the plastic flow of the matrix is described by a criterion that involves dependence on all stress invariants. In such cases, although a strain-rate potential is known, the stress-based potential cannot be obtained explicitly. While the proposed framework based on strain-rate potentials is general, for comparison purposes in this work we present an illustration of the approach for the case of a porous solid with von Mises matrix containing randomly distributed spherical cavities. Comparison between simulations using the strain-rate based approach and the classical stress-based Gurson’s criterion in uniaxial tension is presented. These results show that the model based on a strain-rate potential predicts the dilatational response with the same level of accuracy.                    ',\n",

The latter approach has several advantages whenever material parameters are determined by means of texture measurements and crystal plasticity simulations. This paper deals with a phenomenological description of anisotropy in elastoplastic rate-insensitive models, by using strain-rate potentials. A fully implicit time integration algorithm is developed in this framework and implemented in a static-implicit finite element code. Algorithmic details are discussed, including the derivation of the consistent (algorithmic) tangent modulus and the numerical treatment of the yield condition. Typical sheet-forming applications are simulated with the proposed implementation, using the recent non-quadratic strain-rate potential Srp2004-18p. Numerical simulations are carried out for materials that exhibit strong plastic anisotropy. The numerical results confirm that the presented algorithm exhibits the same generality, robustness, accuracy, and time-efficiency as state-of-the-art yield-criterion-based algorithms.

In the case of diffuse necking, a comparison is made between the criteria based on bifurcation analysis and on those based on maximum force principle for elastic-plastic materials. In the case of localized modes, it is shown that the predictions of the Marciniak - Kuczynski approach, based on a multizone model, tend to those of the loss of ellipticity criterion when the initial defect size tends to zero (no initial defect introduced).

Classical forming limit diagrams are known not to apply properly to the cut edges. However, with mild steels the sheet edges usually behave better than the Forming Limit Diagram predictions, so this phenomenon has not been given sufficient attention. In contrast, for Advanced High Strength Steels the cut edges exhibit reduced formability as compared to the plain sheet; this effect is very sensitive to the quality of the cutting process. The current investigation is aimed to evaluate the ability of available damage models to predict this effect on sample applications. The Gurson-Tvergaard-Needleman model is used and the material parameters for a Dual Phase steel are considered [1]. The effect of the cutting process is described by means of initial fields of equivalent plastic strain and porosity. The geometrical distribution and typical values for these two initial fields are devised based on literature. Numerical simulations of flat notched tensile tests are used within the FE code Abaqus/Explicit to illustrate the impact of the initial fields on the moment and the location of the failure initiation. The influence of the mesh size in the cutting-affected area is also investigated. The hole expansion test and a flat bending test are further simulated to investigate the influence of the cut edge.                    ',\n",

A new formulation is proposed, which includes former models as particular cases and allows for an arbitrary number of linear transformations, involving an increasing number of anisotropy parameters. The formulation is convex and fully three-dimensional, thus being suitable for computer implementation in finite element codes. The parameter identification procedure uses a micromechanical model to generate evenly distributed reference points in the full space of possible loading modes. Material parameters are determined for several anisotropic, fcc and bcc sheet metals, and the gain in accuracy of the new models is demonstrated. For the considered materials, increasing the number of linear transformations leads to a systematic improvement of the accuracy, up to a number of five linear transformations. The proposed model fits very closely the predictions of the micromechanical model in the whole space of plastic strain-rate directions. The r-values, which are not directly used in the identification procedure, served for the validation of the models and to demonstrate their improved accuracy.                    ',\n",

More and more flexible models imply higher and higher costs in terms of parameter identification, computer implementation and simulation time, and robust comparison is often compromised by the inconsistent predictions of advanced models under monotonic loading. In this paper, a simple and general approach is proposed for the alteration of advanced hardening models in order to make them rigorously identical to each other under monotonic loading. This objective was reached without any drawback other than the addition of the corresponding equations. On the contrary, the flexibility and accuracy of the selected models was improved, and the parameter identification procedure became simpler, more accurate and more robust. Three material models of increasing complexity were selected to demonstrate the interest of this approach with respect to a complete set of characterisation experiments for a DP600 sheet steel.

       " '\\nAbstract : Sheet metal forming processes involve multi-axial strain paths. For the numerical simulation of such processes, an appropriate constitutive model that properly describes material behavior at large strain is required. For accurate and time-effective simulations, it is crucial to use plasticity models based on physics, as material macroscopic behavior is closely related to the evolution of the associated microstructures. Accordingly, a large strain work-hardening phenomenological model that incorporates the intragranular microstructure evolution through a dislocation density approach is proposed. The model is defined by a yield criterion and hardening laws that are all grain-size dependent. The classical Hill criterion in which grain-size dependency was introduced is proposed. Hardening laws are given by a combination of kinematic and isotropic contributions that respectively take into account the evolution with strain of cell blocks formed by geometrically necessary boundaries (GNBs) and individual dislocation cells delineated by incidental dislocation boundaries within cell blocks (IDBs). On the one hand, IDBs evolution contribution is described by a modified Rauch et al. isotropic model, which is able to describe work-hardening stagnation and work-softening. On the other hand, GNBs evolution contribution is described by a grain-size dependent tensorial back-stress expression proposed by Aouafi et al. [2007] to describe the plastic anisotropy and Bauschinger effect. Moreover, the proposed model aims to accurately predict steel behavior through an innovative approach by only changing few “simply measurable” microstructure data (e.g. chemical composition, grain size…). The predictive capabilities of the model are assessed for interstitial free (IF) and dual phase (DP) steels with grain sizes varying respectively in the 8-40 µm and 1-10 µm value range. Different loading paths are analyzed, namely the uniaxial tensile test, reversal simple shear and orthogonal tests.                    ',\n",

For this purpose, the model was implemented in a commercial finite element code and was used to simulate the cross-die deep drawing test. Deep drawing experiments and numerical simulations were conducted for five interstitial-free steels and seven dual-phase steels, each of them having a different thickness and strength. The main interest of the adopted model is a very efficient parameter identification procedure, due to the physical background of the model and the physical significance of some of its parameters and state variables. Indeed, the dislocation density, grain size, and martensite volume fraction explicitly enter the model’s formulation, although the overall approach is macroscopic. For the dual-phase steels, only the chemical composition and the average grain sizes were measured for the martensite and ferrite grains, as well as the martensite volume fraction. The mild steels required three additional tensile tests along three directions, in order to describe the plastic anisotropy. Information concerning the transient mechanical behavior after strain-path changes (reverse and orthogonal) was not collected for each material, but for only one material of each family of steels (IF, DP), based on previous works available in the literature. This minimalistic experimental base was used to feed the numerical simulations for the twelve materials that were confronted to deep drawing experiments in terms of thickness distributions. The results suggested that the accuracy of the numerical simulations is very satisfactory in spite of the scarce experimental input data. Additional investigations indicated that the modeling of the transient behavior due to strain-path changes may have a significant impact on the simulation results, and that the adopted approach provides a simple and efficient alternative in this regard.

The Finite Element Method (FEM) is quite successful to simulate metal forming processes but accuracy largely depends on the quality of the material properties provided as input to the material model. Common phenomenological models roughly consist in the fitting of functions on experimental results and do not provide any predictive character for different metals from the same grade. Therefore, the use of accurate plasticity models based on physics would increase predictive capability, reduce parameter identification cost and allow for robust and time-effective finite element simulations. For this purpose, a 3D physically based model at large strain with dislocation density evolution approach was presented in IDDRG2009 by the authors [1]. This model allows the description of work-hardening's behavior for different loading paths (i.e. uni-axial tensile, simple shear and Bauschinger tests) taking into account several data from microstructure (i.e. grain size, texture, etc...). The originality of this model consists in the introduction of microstructure data in a classical phenomenological model in order to achieve work-hardening's predictive character for different metals from the same grade. Indeed, thanks to a microstructure parameter set for an Interstitial Free steel, it is possible to describe work-hardening behavior for different loading paths of other IF steels by only changing the mean grain size and the chemical composition. During sheet metal forming processes local material points may experience multi-axial and multi-path loadings. Before simulating actual industrial parts, automotive manufacturers use validation tools - e.g. the Cross-Die stamping test. Such typical stamping tests enable the evaluation of a complex distribution of strains. The work described is an implementation [2] of a 3D dislocation based model in ABAQUS/Explicit and its validation on a Finite Element (FE) Cross-Die model. In order to assess the performance and relevance of the 3D dislocation based model in the simulation of industrial forming applications, the results of thinning profiles predicted along several directions and the strain distribution were obtained and compared with experimental results for IF steels with grain sizes varying in the 8-22 μm value range.                    \",\n",

       " '\\nRésumé : Abrupt strain path changes without elastic unloading have been used in the literature to investigate the yield surface of sheet metals, both experimentally and theoretically. Such pioneering studies emphasized an apparent non-normality of the plastic strain rate tensor with respect to the trace of the yield surface in stress space, following such a strain-path change. They inspired numerous subsequent developments of plasticity models including non-associated flow rules. In this paper, this type of abrupt strain-path changes is investigated using state-of-the-art plasticity models. The aim is to emphasize the respective contributions of elasticity, isotropic-kinematic hardening, and rate sensitivity, to the apparent violation of the normality condition. The results show that these classical ingredients of plasticity models significantly contribute to the apparent vertex and loss of normality. These effects are quantified for typical sheet metals subject to biaxial-to-shear orthogonal strain path change.                    ',\n",

Hardening identification of large strains is a trade-off between cost, standardization and the ability to represent the experiment, but there are no standard procedures to date. In this proposed approach, large strains (larger than 1) are reached using an industrial wire drawing process, and measured data for identification are obtained from standard tensile tests. Fast semi-analytical post-processing was possible despite the significant process-inherited strain heterogeneity. The parameters of state-of-the-art hardening models were identified, and the robustness was demonstrated to reach far beyond the strain level attained in the experiments. As a consequence, accurate and robust large strain hardening modelling was achieved from standard (tensile test) acquisition by using industrial wire drawing pre-strains.                    ',\n",

A spring-mass-damping model of the machine and tools system is associated with a billet model to describe hammer-forming operations only during the forging phase. Themodel parameters are identifiedwith experimental measurements of process variables during a stroke, providing parameters specifically adapted to the machine-tools system. Then, model predictions are validated by the experimental upsetting of steel and aluminium billets. The model accurately predicts forging process variables for consecutive blows with different materials. The decrease in process efficiency and the evolution from inelastic to elastic blows after several strokes on the same billet are also predicted by the model. This methodology provides a new, tailored solution that enables forging manufacturers to predict the forging energy consumption of their own machines.

This paper presents an approach to estimate the influence of some factors on the distortion, based on the idea of a distortion potential taking into account not only geometry but also the manufacturing process history. Then the idea is developed through experiments on an industrial manufacturing process to understand the impact of residual stress due to machining on shaft bending and teeth distortion during heat treatment. Instead of being measured, residual stress is being neutralized. By comparing lots between each other, connections between gear teeth geometry and manufacturing steps before heat treatment are obtained. As a consequence, geometrical nonconformities roots can be determined more easily thanks to this diagnosis tool, and corrective actions can be applied. Secondly, the influence of product geometry on bending is experimentally considered. Moreover, metallurgical observations enable to explain the influence of workpieces geometry on shaft bending. Thanks to the obtained results, process and product recommendations to decrease shafts bending are proposed.                    ',\n",

More and more flexible models imply higher and higher costs in terms of parameter identification, computer implementation and simulation time, and robust comparison is often compromised by the inconsistent predictions of advanced models under monotonic loading. In this paper, a simple and general approach is proposed for the alteration of advanced hardening models in order to make them rigorously identical to each other under monotonic loading. This objective was reached without any drawback other than the addition of the corresponding equations. On the contrary, the flexibility and accuracy of the selected models was improved, and the parameter identification procedure became simpler, more accurate and more robust. Three material models of increasing complexity were selected to demonstrate the interest of this approach with respect to a complete set of characterisation experiments for a DP600 sheet steel.

CWR transforms a cylindrical billet into a complex axisymmetrical shape with an accurate distribution of material. This preform is forged into shape in a forging die. In order to improve CWR tool lifecycle and product quality it is essential to understand tool wear evolution and the physical phenomena that change on the CWR process due to the resulting geometry of the tool when undergoing tool wear. In order to understand CWR tool wear behavior, numerical simulations are necessary. Nevertheless, if the simulations are performed with the CAD geometry of the tool, results are limited. To solve this difficulty, two numerical simulations with FORGE® were performed using the real geometry of the tools (both up and lower roll) at two different states: (1) before starting lifecycle and (2) end of lifecycle. The tools were 3D measured with ATOS triple scan by GOM® using optical 3D measuring techniques. The result was a high-resolution point cloud of the entire geometry of the tool. Each 3D point cloud was digitalized and converted into a STL format. The geometry of the tools in a STL format was input for the 3D simulations. Both simulations were compared. Defects of products obtained in simulation were compared to main defects of products found industrially. Two main defects are: (a) surface defects on the preform that are not fixed in the die forging operation; and (b) Preform bent (no longer straight), with two possible impacts: on the one hand that the robot cannot grab it to take it to the forging stage; on the other hand, an unfilled section in the forging operation.

However, for cost reasons or for specific applications the magnetic core can be made from massive steel and thus manufactured with adapted processes such as forging. Such process may lead to inhomogeneous and degraded magnetic properties. Therefore, this study proposes a specific device for characterizing magnetic properties of samples which are to be representative of a massive part.\\r\\nThe measure is based on the Faraday’s equation to determine the magnetic flux density and the Hall effect to estimate the magnetic field inside the sample. Practically this is realized with classical components such as Hall probes, a secondary winding and an electromagnet device. However their combination is unique to perform magnetic characterization on massive samples, which are less affected by the sampling technique and may have anisotropic properties. The device is dimensioned thanks to FE-Simulation and validated according repeatability, sensitivity and trueness analysis. Eventually the characterization is performed on samples with different material parameters showing the effect of the grain size on the specific losses.

In this context, blacksmiths developed a new range of workpieces called “Net Shape”, i. e. their functional surfaces are achieved by forging, thus eliminating the following reworking machining operations. New needs appeared in the forging industry, like the precision monitoring. This control aims at certifying that the workpiece has the required geometrical measurements, but also to better understand every manufacturing process steps. In order to evaluate step by step the manufacturing process and the obtained workpiece functionality it is necessary to accurately choose the measurand without to question the workpiece tolerance and the manufacturing process. In this work, the choice of the measurand to check a forged “Net Shape” bevel pinion for automobile differential is dwelt framework of two goals. Firstly, the measured surface must be representative of a meshing. This implies the study of the pinion's normalized parameters and the way to evaluate them. Secondly, it has to allow a better understanding of the manufacturing process in order to improve it. The new methodology developed in this paper requires the use of a coordinate measuring machine. This method is more suitable to measure the functional surfaces. The results analysis is carried out thanks to a mathematical vector approach. Thus, it allows the dissociation of the influence- once it has been identified-of each physical or technological phenomenon which is representative of the workpiece functionality or the manufacturing process. The study of the pinion after each manufacturing process step enables to better understand the physical phenomena involved in order to develop the mathematical model describing their effects.

The main question is to identify the value of a supposedly well known Appellation of Origin (namely “Appellation d’Origine Contrôlée Bourgogne”) compared to other quality signals like grape variety or brand, in the lowermiddle range segment of the market. In order to assess the respective values of these different characteristics for consumers, the experiments compares wine made from the same grape variety, “Pinot Noir”, which is the grape variety of red Burgundy wines. Sessions were carried out in France, and Germany. Real sales at a random selling price,based on the Becker, DeGroot, Marschak (BDM) mechanism, revealed consumers’ WTP in three different information conditions (blind tasting, label examination, tasting and label examination). Results show that sensory characteristics and label information influence differently French and German consumers. They also reveal that Appellation of Origin information is of little value outside the country of origin for middle range wines. Moreover, it appears that the small differences observed in mean WTP for each wine, in each country and information condition do not result from consumers’ lack of discrimination. Participants in both samples display strong individual preferences,however being very heterogeneous these preferences tend to cancel out when individual WTP are aggregated.                    ',\n",

Over the years, several efforts have been made on the calibration of the different instruments to establish a consistent land surface reflectance time-series and to augment the AVHRR data record with data from other sensors, such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). In this paper, we present a summary of all the corrections applied to the AVHRR surface reflectance and NDVI Version 4 Product, developed in the framework of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Data Record (CDR) program. These corrections result from assessment of the geolocation, improvement of cloud masking, and calibration monitoring. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of the surface reflectance over the AERONET sites by a cross-comparison with MODIS, which is an already validated product, and evaluation of a downstream leaf area index (LAI) product. We demonstrate the utility of this long time-series by estimating the winter wheat yield over the USA. The methods developed by Becker-Reshef et al. (2010) and Franch et al. (2015) are applied to both the MODIS and AVHRR data. Comparison of the results from both sensors during the MODIS-era shows the consistency of the dataset with similar errors of 10%. When applying the methods to AVHRR historical data from the 1980s, the results have errors equivalent to those derived from MODIS.                    ',\n",

Who initiated the process  and today who keeps participating in it, and in doing so, according to which strategies ? This thesis seeks to answer these questions by gathering together the concepts of fields and legitimacy developed by Pierre Bourdieu but also by borrowing theories and methodologies from art socioloists such as Howard Becker, Serge Chaumier, Jean-Louis Fabiani, Nathalie Heinich, Bernard Lahire, Eric Maigret, Raymonde Moulin, or Alain Quemin. By questioning the three poles formed by the artists, the institutions and the art market, we have established a corpus of events, of strip cartoonists highlighted by these events and of the producers of these same events.  By studying their declarations and by meeting them to interview them, we have analysed their motivations. We have finally come to establish the relativity of the legitimation of comics both for their quality and the number of the individuals concerned. Despite the fact that a generational phenomenon has been given prominence in the evolution of the status and the recognition of comics, we can conclude that the acquisition of a semi-legitimacy (to employ Jean-Louis Fabiani’s own word) by the ninth art is more of a fact than a dynamic process in development.

The volume fractions of the liquid and solid phases in the semi-solid state are the most important parameters for such a form-ing process, as they aﬀect the viscosity and hence the ﬂow behavior of the material. Two-dimensional observations might not always be suﬃcient, as the size distribution and the connectivity of phases cannot be obtained from associated measurements, which can only be determined by three-dimensional (3-D) investigation. This paper presents the ﬁrst application of high-energy X-ray microtomography to the microstructure of steel in the semi-solid state. The microstructure of M2 high-speed tool steel was studied in both as-received and heated-and-quenched states. From the reconstructed images, 3-D information could be obtained and was compared with scanning elec-tron microscopy and energy dispersive spectrometry observations. The volume fraction and the location of liquid phase in the semi-solid state were determined in particular, and the continuous solid skeleton was investigated.                    ',\n",

In this work, we are interested in analysing the influence of thermal conditions as well as ram speed on the flow behaviour and the microstructure of the final parts. To do so, thixo-extrusion tests on a high speed hydraulic press were performed on C38 steels using different ram speeds and different temperatures for the tools. The temperature is measured in the die close to the tool-material interface during the whole process. Correlations between the temperature measurements, the flow profile and the microstructure are discussed. Using the Finite Element code Forge2005, these thixo-extrusion tests are simulated.

There exists plethora of fast algorithms for smooth convex optimization, but these algorithms are not readily applicable to nonsmooth problems , which has led to a considerable amount of research in this direction. In this paper, we propose a general algorithm for nonsmooth bound-constrained convex optimization problems. Our algorithm is instance of the so-called augmented Lagrangian, for which theoretical convergence is well established for convex problems. The proposed algorithm is a blend of superlinearly convergent limited memory quasi-Newton method, and proximal projection operator. The initial promising numerical results for total-variation based image deblurring show that they are as fast as the best existing algorithms in the same class, but with fewer and less sensitive tuning parameters, which makes a huge difference in practice.

However, in children 5 years and younger, the clinical symptoms of asthma are variable and non-specific. Furthermore, neither airflow limitation nor airway inflammation can be assessed routinely in this age group. For this reason, to aid in the diagnosis of asthma in young children, a symptoms-only descriptive approach that includes the definition of various wheezing phenotypes has been recommended2. In 1993, the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) was implemented to develop a network of individuals, organizations, and public health officials to disseminate information about the care of patients with asthma while at the same time assuring a mechanism to incorporate the results of scientific investigations into asthma care. In this report, Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention in Children 5 Years and Younger, an effort has been made to present the special challenges that must be taken into account in managing asthma in children during the first 5 years of life, including difficulties with diagnosis, the efficacy and safety of drugs and drug delivery systems, and the lack of data on new therapies.

After analyzing the results thus obtained, it was identified that the aforementioned parameters mainly affect thermal exchanges between die and part.

It benefits from the complex thixotropic behaviour of semi-solids. However, the consequences of such behaviour on the flow during thixoforming, is still neither completely characterized and nor fully understood, especially for high melting point alloys. The study described in this paper investigates thixoextrusion for C38 low carbon steel material using dies at temperatures much lower than the slug temperature. Four different process parameters were studied: the initial slug temperature, the die temperature, the ram speed and the presence of a ceramic layer at the tool/material interface. The extruded parts were found to have an exact shape and a good surface state only if the temperature was below a certain value. This critical temperature is not an intrinsic material property since its value depends on die temperature and the presence of the Ceraspray©layer. Two kinds of flow were highlighted: a homogeneous flow controlled by the behaviour of the solid skeleton characterized by a positive strain rate sensitivity, and a non homogeneous flow (macro liquid/solid phase separation) dominated by the flow of the free liquid. With decreasing ram speed, heat losses increase so that the overall consistency of the material improves, leading to apparent negative strain rate sensitivity.

       " '\\nAbstract : Image deblurring is essential in high resolution imaging, e.g., astronomy, microscopy or computational photography. Shift-invariant blur is fully characterized by a single point-spread-function (PSF). Blurring is then modeled by a convolution, leading to efficient algorithms for blur simulation and removal that rely on fast Fourier transforms. However, in many different contexts, blur cannot be considered constant throughout the field-of-view, and thus necessitates to model variations of the PSF with the location. These models must achieve a trade-off between the accuracy that can be reached with their flexibility, and their computational efficiency. Several fast approximations of blur have been proposed in the literature. We give a unified presentation of these methods in the light of matrix decompositions of the blurring operator. We establish the connection between different computational tricks that can be found in the litterature and the physical sense of corresponding approximations in terms of equivalent PSFs, physically-based approximations being preferable. We derive an improved approximation that preserves the same desirable low complexity as other fast algorithms while reaching a minimal approximation error. Comparison of theoretical properties and empirical performances of each blur approximation suggests that the proposed general model is preferable for approximation and inversion of a known shift-variant blur.

Therefore, it is necessary to well understand the microstructure evolution during high speed heating and forming. Classically, it is investigated on a solid material quenched from semi-solid state by 2D characterization techniques. However, the semi-solid microstructure could probably not be preserved in the solid state by quenching due to complicated phase transformations or high diffusion rate of alloying elements during cooling, especially at low liquid fractions. In order to avoid this, a new in situ technique - high temperature Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM) - was developed and used for studying the microstructure evolution directly at high temperature. The present study aims at providing an experimental investigation of the microstructure evolution on several steel grades (M2, 100Cr6 and C38LTT) during heating from the as-received state to the semi-solid state (heating rate: ~200°C/min) and finally cooled to the solid state (cooling rate: ~200°C/min). It has been found that the temperature sensitivity of liquid fraction (ΔT/ Δfl) of these grades is much\\r\\ndifferent. In addition, during cooling, there is a significant difference in diffusion rate of alloying elements between these grades. In M2, thanks to the high content of alloying elements and their low diffusion rate, the semi-solid temperature range is greater and its microstructure in the semi-solid state could be preserved by quenching process or even at a low cooling rate. On the contrary, the microstructure of other steel grades 100Cr6 and C38LTT in semi-solid state can only be revealed by CLSM at high temperature, because of the lower volume fraction of alloying elements and their high diffusion rate. It is very interesting to use high temperature CLSM to in situ investigate the microstructure evolution in the semi-solid state, especially at low liquid fraction. Since the microstructure of M2 in the semi-solid state can be reserved after cooling, it is possible to identify liquid area by the post-mortem examination. Therefore, the material flow behavior of thixoforged parts could be investigated.                    ',\n",

The paper addresses the case of a seven-phase Surface-mounted\\r\\nPermanent Magnet (SPM) machine which has a fundamental winding factor lower than the third. This so-called bi-harmonic\\r\\nspecificity is considered in order to achieve good torque quality (average value and ripples). Regarding the design, the magnet\\r\\nlayer is segmented into two identical radially magnetized tiles that cover about three-quarters the pole arc. Regarding the control,\\r\\nthe rated Maximum Torque Per Ampere (MTPA) supply strategy (h1h3 control) aims at generating a third harmonic current\\r\\ncomponent greater than the fundamental. A prototype has been manufactured: the ability of the machine to provide smooth\\r\\ntorque is experimentally confirmed through the implementation of a simple MTPA control which copes with high distortion in\\r\\nno-load voltage.

       " '\\nAbstract : What does it mean to be happy? The vast majority of cross-cultural studies on happiness have employed a Western-origin, or “WEIRD” measure of happiness that conceptualizes it as a self-centered (or “independent”), high-arousal emotion. However, research from Eastern cultures, particularly Japan, conceptualizes happiness as including an interpersonal aspect emphasizing harmony and connectedness to others. Following a combined emic-etic approach (Cheung, van de Vijver & Leong, 2011), we assessed the cross-cultural applicability of a measure of independent happiness developed in the US (Subjective Happiness Scale; Lyubomirsky & Lepper, 1999) and a measure of interdependent happiness developed in Japan (Interdependent Happiness Scale; Hitokoto & Uchida, 2015), with data from 63 countries representing 7 sociocultural regions. Results indicate that the schema of independent happiness was more coherent in more WEIRD countries. In contrast, the coherence of interdependent happiness was unrelated to a country’s “WEIRD-ness.” Reliabilities of both happiness measures were lowest in African and Middle Eastern countries, suggesting these two conceptualizations of happiness may not be globally comprehensive. Overall, while the two measures had many similar correlates and properties, the self-focused concept of independent happiness is “WEIRD-er” than interdependent happiness, suggesting cross-cultural researchers should attend to both conceptualizations.

To reach this goal, it is important to understand the context of this study. First of all, relations between the customer and the supplier are moving. The main consequence of this change is the transfer of the design step from the customer to the supplier. Moreover, we can observe an evolution of the forge process with the development of high dimensional quality forged components (\"Net Shape\") for automotive industry. Our design analyse of forged parts shows the potentialities of those new process are not completely exploited today. The principal reason is the bad integration of manufacture knowledge during the design step. This observation led us to create an integrated design approach including manufacture and product functionality control. This one is intuitive because, we think it is essential to adapt our work to the application. Thus, the method can be summarized in three main steps: the analyse of existing activities, the identification and knowledge acquisition to improve products and to finish, the structuring and the capitalization of those knowledge. We have applied the approach to differential forged gears. Thanks to this method, we have created an original gear geometry taking in consideration forge process constraints and potentialities. Moreover, we have highlighted the necessity to develop a specific mechanical dimensioning. In parallel, we have realised appraisals (showed in a confidential report) to collect the essential knowledge to optimize the conical gear design. The method we have created was tested on two industrial project of differential design. Some test results on gear meshing have allowed to quantify the improvement on the nominal geometry. Today, we are making some mechanical resistance tests to end the validation of the method.                                    ',\n",

Fast semi-analytical post-processing was possible despite the significant process-inherited strain heterogeneity. The parameters of state-of-the-art hardening models were identified, and the robustness was demonstrated to reach far beyond the strain level attained in the experiments.

This paper illustrates several experimental research activities for thixoextrusion of 7075 aluminum alloy being carried out within the “Arts et Métiers ParisTech” of METZ. Inductive re-heating of the aluminum billet is the method to enable the desired liquid fraction for thixoextrusion. Experimental results show that after induction reheating the solid particles obtained has globular shape and homogeneous dimension. A sample obtained from a direct extruded bar is inserted in a die and thixoextruded after reheating in semisolid state. In laboratory experiments the temperature it was directly controlled applying thermocouples for temperature measurements in the slug and also in the die. The experimental tests were made for two different working speeds on the mechanical eccentric press. The preliminary experimental results on extrusion load and microstructure evolution of the product are reported.

       " '\\nAbstract : Energy saving has become a real issue in process management and has led to the analysis of the energy consumption of forging machines, for the purpose of optimization. This study focuses on the amount of energy lost due to machine behaviour during the forming process. A spring-mass-damping model of the machine and tools system is associated with a billet model to describe hammer-forming operations only during the forging phase. Themodel parameters are identifiedwith experimental measurements of process variables during a stroke, providing parameters specifically adapted to the machine-tools system. Then, model predictions are validated by the experimental upsetting of steel and aluminium billets. The model accurately predicts forging process variables for consecutive blows with different materials. The decrease in process efficiency and the evolution from inelastic to elastic blows after several strokes on the same billet are also predicted by the model. This methodology provides a new, tailored solution that enables forging manufacturers to predict the forging energy consumption of their own machines. The approach developed in this work concerns gravity drop hammers but is also transferable to other energy-driven machines.                    ',\n",

The volume fractions of the liquid and solid phases in the semi-solid state are the most important parameters for such a form-ing process, as they aﬀect the viscosity and hence the ﬂow behavior of the material. Two-dimensional observations might not always be suﬃcient, as the size distribution and the connectivity of phases cannot be obtained from associated measurements, which can only be determined by three-dimensional (3-D) investigation. This paper presents the ﬁrst application of high-energy X-ray microtomography to the microstructure of steel in the semi-solid state. The microstructure of M2 high-speed tool steel was studied in both as-received and heated-and-quenched states. From the reconstructed images, 3-D information could be obtained and was compared with scanning elec-tron microscopy and energy dispersive spectrometry observations.

These advantages result from the shear thinning flow behaviour of semi-solids due to microstructure changes during the material deformation. Many parameters such as steel grade, raw speed, slug temperature, tool temperature influence the steel thixoforging process. In this work, we are interested in analysing the influence of thermal conditions as well as ram speed on the flow behaviour and the microstructure of the final parts. To do so, thixo-extrusion tests on a high speed hydraulic press were performed on C38 steels using different ram speeds and different temperatures for the tools. The temperature is measured in the die close to the tool-material interface during the whole process. Correlations between the temperature measurements, the flow profile and the microstructure are discussed. Using the Finite Element code Forge2005, these thixo-extrusion tests are simulated. Using an inverse method, some parameters used in the thermal exchange modelling are identified by successive comparisons between calculated and measured temperatures within the die.

In this work 15 kg walls are built with an effective building rate of 4.85 kg/h using an ER100 wire providing good tensile properties and toughness under welding conditions. The thermal evolution of the walls during manufacturing is measured by thermocouples and an IR camera: it depends on process parameters, deposit strategy and the size of the part. The walls are then characterised as deposit and after heat treatment through hardness, tensile and Charpy-V notch tests. The results show a fine microstructure with unexpected retained austenite and coarse allotriomorphic ferrite in the as deposited walls. The final hardness values vary from about 220 to 280 HV2; the yield stress and tensile strength are 520 and 790 MPa, respectively, and a toughness of about 50 J is obtained at room temperature. The heat treatment transforms the retained austenite, leading to an improvement of the yield\\r\\nstress to 600 MPa.                    ',\n",

The macrostructure and microstructure of the interface and of the co-based superalloy layers are studied. The interface presents the form of wavelets with a period of 1000 µm and an amplitude of 250 µm. The superalloy grains are deformed during the cladding process with several slip systems appearing. Near to the interface, the superalloy grains elongate and tend to follow the geometry of the interface. Observation with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) reveals zones of localised fusion at the interface. The EDS analysis shows that these fusion zones are the result of mixing between the base and cladding plates. Radiocrystallographic analysis by X-ray diffraction reveals the presence of the f.c.c cobalt in the cobalt-based superalloy layer. Thus cobalt retains its crystallographic structure (f.c.c) after cladding process. Hardness is evaluated with reference to microstructure. Near the interface, the hardness of the superalloy is of the order of 600 HV1 kg. In the remainder of the thickness, hardness is of the order of 500 HV1 kg, being greater than that of the unplated superalloy (270 HV1 kg). The track obtained by an indentation test at the interface under a load of 100 kg exhibits no cracking. This tends to prove the good metallurgical bond at the interface.                    ',\n",

This phenomenon is particularly obvious in the case of gearbox parts because of their typical geometry and precise requirements. Even if distortion can be anticipated to an extent by experience, it remains complex to comprehend. Scientific literature and industrial experience show that the whole manufacturing process chain has an influence on final heat treatment distortions. This paper presents an approach to estimate the influence of some factors on the distortion, based on the idea of a distortion potential taking into account not only geometry but also the manufacturing process history. Then the idea is developed through experiments on an industrial manufacturing process to understand the impact of residual stress due to machining on shaft bending and teeth distortion during heat treatment. Instead of being measured, residual stress is being neutralized. By comparing lots between each other, connections between gear teeth geometry and manufacturing steps before heat treatment are obtained. As a consequence, geometrical nonconformities roots can be determined more easily thanks to this diagnosis tool, and corrective actions can be applied. Secondly, the influence of product geometry on bending is experimentally considered. Moreover, metallurgical observations enable to explain the influence of workpieces geometry on shaft bending. Thanks to the obtained results, process and product recommendations to decrease shafts bending are proposed.                    ',\n",

Taking advantage of the thixotropic behavior of alloys in the semi-solid state, significant progress has been made in semi-solid processing. However, the consequences of such behavior on the flow during thixoforming are still not completely understood. To explore and better understand the influence of the different parameters on material flow during thixoextrusion process, thixoextrusion experiments were performed using the low carbon steel C38. The billet was partially melted at high solid fraction. Effects of various process parameters including the initial billet temperature, the temperature of die, the punch speed during process and the presence of a Ceraspray layer at the interface of tool and billet were investigated through experiments and simulation. After analyzing the results thus obtained, it was identified that the aforementioned parameters mainly affect thermal exchanges between die and part. The Ceraspray layer not only plays a lubricant role, but also acts as a thermal barrier at the interface of tool and billet. Furthermore, the thermal effects can affect the material flow which is composed of various distinct zones.                    ',\n",

CWR transforms a cylindrical billet into a complex axisymmetrical shape with an accurate distribution of material. This preform is forged into shape in a forging die. In order to improve CWR tool lifecycle and product quality it is essential to understand tool wear evolution and the physical phenomena that change on the CWR process due to the resulting geometry of the tool when undergoing tool wear. In order to understand CWR tool wear behavior, numerical simulations are necessary. Nevertheless, if the simulations are performed with the CAD geometry of the tool, results are limited. To solve this difficulty, two numerical simulations with FORGE® were performed using the real geometry of the tools (both up and lower roll) at two different states: (1) before starting lifecycle and (2) end of lifecycle. The tools were 3D measured with ATOS triple scan by GOM® using optical 3D measuring techniques. The result was a high-resolution point cloud of the entire geometry of the tool. Each 3D point cloud was digitalized and converted into a STL format. The geometry of the tools in a STL format was input for the 3D simulations. Both simulations were compared. Defects of products obtained in simulation were compared to main defects of products found industrially. Two main defects are: (a) surface defects on the preform that are not fixed in the die forging operation; and (b) Preform bent (no longer straight), with two possible impacts: on the one hand that the robot cannot grab it to take it to the forging stage; on the other hand, an unfilled section in the forging operation.

It benefits from the complex thixotropic behaviour of semi-solids. However, the consequences of such behaviour on the flow during thixoforming, is still neither completely characterized and nor fully understood, especially for high melting point alloys. The study described in this paper investigates thixoextrusion for C38 low carbon steel material using dies at temperatures much lower than the slug temperature. Four different process parameters were studied: the initial slug temperature, the die temperature, the ram speed and the presence of a ceramic layer at the tool/material interface. The extruded parts were found to have an exact shape and a good surface state only if the temperature was below a certain value. This critical temperature is not an intrinsic material property since its value depends on die temperature and the presence of the Ceraspray©layer. Two kinds of flow were highlighted: a homogeneous flow controlled by the behaviour of the solid skeleton characterized by a positive strain rate sensitivity, and a non homogeneous flow (macro liquid/solid phase separation) dominated by the flow of the free liquid. With decreasing ram speed, heat losses increase so that the overall consistency of the material improves, leading to apparent negative strain rate sensitivity. Finally, some ways to optimise thixoforming are proposed.                    ',\n",
       " '\\nRésumé : Semi-solid processing is a promising forming process for shaping metallic alloys in one shot. Numerical simulations are of great interest for optimizing the process. Generally, numerical simulation results are compared with interrupted ﬂow experiments but these do not fully reﬂect the progress of material into the die because of the inertia of the ﬂowing material which continues to move after the interruption to the shot. Results are available for in situ visualization of ﬂow using transparent sided dies. Here die ﬁlling with a 90◦ change of ﬂow path was simulated using the FORGE© ﬁnite element code and a constitutive equation based on a micro-macro modelling approach. The predicted ﬂow behaviour was compared to the in situ visualization images obtained with a transparent glass sided die and reported in the literature. The impact of the presence of an obstacle, ram speed and friction coefﬁcients on the material ﬂow front is discussed. The initial solid skeleton is broken as soon as the material is deformed. The effect of the ram speed on the ﬂow front is successfully represented by keeping the same parameters for the constitutive laws but requires a change in the friction coefﬁcients. Friction modelling using the Coulomb law limited by Tresca cannot represent  the ram  speed effect  on experimental  friction conditions  for the in  situ visualisation tests used for the comparison here. However, the effect of an obstacle within the die on the material ﬂow front is predicted well.                    ',\n",

It improves not only mechanical and surface properties of workpiece but the integration of vibration in metal forming process has also been helpful in the reduction of forming force required for the process. Majority of the work done before in this field is related to single vibration source vibration and its application in metal forming process. The aim of this work is to develop a mathematical model for multi vibration assisted forging process. The combination of multi mechanical vibrations generates a complicated movement of lower die without deforming it. This developed mathematical model proves that movement is basically in the form of progressive wave in the lower die thus resulting local surface movement. In reality this movement can be generated by the vibration given by multi piezoelectric actuators. Based on this mathematical model, simulations using finite element software Forge2011® have been performed to observe the presence of progressive wave in the workpiece. The simulations’ kinematics confirms the existence of progressive wave in the workpiece. Simulation results demonstrate the effect of progressive wave to reduce the forging force, reduction of friction on the lower surface of die and hence improvement the forging process.

It is crucial to study the microstructure in the semi-solid state to improve the understanding of the thixoforging process since the material behavior strongly depends on main parameters: the liquid fraction, its distribution as well as the coherence of the solid skeleton.

In order to explore those results, a coupling model has been developed to provide a design tool in a mechatronic frame which consists of an analytical model of the forging process based on simplified visco-plastic laws and a state space model of the piezoelectric actuator based on a finite element approach [1]. The coupling model can be used to analyse the important parameters of the whole process in order to optimize the forging process design using mechanical vibrations or to control the process if necessary. A finite element simulation of forging process using mechanical vibration based on finite element software Forge2008® is also presented in this study. The results obtained by experiment, finite element simulation and simulation using the model above are compared in the case of simple upsetting, with good agreement. Moreover, it can be concluded that high frequencies are not required to observe this phenomenon. Finally visco-plasticity phenomenon is not self-sufficient to explain completely the force reduction.                    ',\n",

       " '\\nAbstract : The microstructure plays a crucial role for steel semi-solid forming process, and\\r\\nparticularly for the steel thixoforging process, since it determines the thixotropic flow behavior of materials in the semi-solid state. Therefore, it is necessary to well understand the microstructure evolution during high speed heating and forming. Classically, it is investigated on a solid material quenched from semi-solid state by 2D characterization techniques. However, the semi-solid microstructure could probably not be preserved in the solid state by quenching due to complicated phase transformations or high diffusion rate of alloying elements during cooling, especially at low liquid fractions. In order to avoid this, a new in situ technique - high temperature Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM) - was developed and used for studying the microstructure evolution directly at high temperature. The present study aims at providing an experimental investigation of the microstructure evolution on several steel grades (M2, 100Cr6 and C38LTT) during heating from the as-received state to the semi-solid state (heating rate: ~200°C/min) and finally cooled to the solid state (cooling rate: ~200°C/min). It has been found that the temperature sensitivity of liquid fraction (ΔT/ Δfl) of these grades is much\\r\\ndifferent. In addition, during cooling, there is a significant difference in diffusion rate of alloying elements between these grades. In M2, thanks to the high content of alloying elements and their low diffusion rate, the semi-solid temperature range is greater and its microstructure in the semi-solid state could be preserved by quenching process or even at a low cooling rate. On the contrary, the microstructure of other steel grades 100Cr6 and C38LTT in semi-solid state can only be revealed by CLSM at high temperature, because of the lower volume fraction of alloying elements and their high diffusion rate. It is very interesting to use high temperature CLSM to in situ investigate the microstructure evolution in the semi-solid state, especially at low liquid fraction. Since the microstructure of M2 in the semi-solid state can be reserved after cooling, it is possible to identify liquid area by the post-mortem examination. Therefore, the material flow behavior of thixoforged parts could be investigated.                    ',\n",
       " '\\nAbstract : Magnetic parts are usually composed of a stack of electrical steel laminations to reduce the eddy current losses. However, for cost reasons or for specific applications the magnetic core can be made from massive steel and thus manufactured with adapted processes such as forging. Such process may lead to inhomogeneous and degraded magnetic properties. Therefore, this study proposes a specific device for characterizing magnetic properties of samples which are to be representative of a massive part.\\r\\nThe measure is based on the Faraday’s equation to determine the magnetic flux density and the Hall effect to estimate the magnetic field inside the sample. Practically this is realized with classical components such as Hall probes, a secondary winding and an electromagnet device. However their combination is unique to perform magnetic characterization on massive samples, which are less affected by the sampling technique and may have anisotropic properties. The device is dimensioned thanks to FE-Simulation and validated according repeatability, sensitivity and trueness analysis. Eventually the characterization is performed on samples with different material parameters showing the effect of the grain size on the specific losses. The expected effect of the grain flow on magnetic properties is however not proven yet.                    ',\n",

       " '\\nAbstract : Vibration assisted forming is one of the most recent and beneficial technique used to improve forming process. Effects of vibration on metal forming processes can be attributed to two causes. First, the volume effect links lowering of yield stress with the influence of vibration on the dislocation movement. Second, the surface effect explains lowering of the effective coefficient of friction by periodic reduction contact area. This work is related to vibration assisted forming process in viscoplastic domain. Impact of change in vibration waveform has been analyzed. For this purpose, two analytical models have been developed for two different types of vibration waveforms (sinusoidal and triangular). These models were developed on the basis of Slice method that is used to find out the required forming force for the process. Final relationships show that application of triangular waveform in forming process is more beneficial as compare to sinusoidal vibrations in terms of reduced forming force. Finite Element Method (FEM) based simulations were performed using Forge2008®and these confirmed the results of analytical models. The ratio of vibration speed to upper die speed is a critical factor in the reduction of the forming force.                    ',\n",
       " \"\\nAbstract : This paper presents a combined analysis of geological and geophysical data collected both onshore and offshore along the northwestern Peru forearc area (3°30'\\xad7°30'S), from the coastal plain to the trench axis. Onshore, geomorphic analysis places constraints on the relative importance of eustatic versus tectonic factors in preserving and modifying the uplifted coastal landforms along the coastal plain. Breaking-wave morphologic markers were dated using the in situ produced 10Be cosmonuclide. The data document a tectonic segmentation, allowing us to differentiate two areas with regard to their evolution through time: the northern Cabo Blanco and the southern Paita-Illesca segments. For the past 200 kyr, both segments uplifted at high rates of 10 to 20 mm yr-1 through tectonic pulses coeval with the eustatic deglacial sea level rises of isotope stage 1 and warm isotope substage 5e, respectively. The uplift and related extensive emersion of the coastal plain require high coupling along the subduction zone and/or underplating at depth. Offshore, industry-acquired reflection seismic lines combined with EM12 bathymetric data allow us to investigate the tectonic regime and deformation of the continental margin and shelf. Major dipping seaward detachments control the long-term subsidence of this area. These main tectonic features define a tectonic segmentation. The Talara, Paita, and Sechura segments are identified from north to south. No clear tectonic correlation in time exists between the onshore and the continental margin segmentations, or in space either. The long-term subsidence of the offshore, indicative of subduction erosion working at depth, requires low coupling along the subduction channel at depth. The distribution of permanent deformation along the northern Peru forearc area includes long-term uplift along the coastal plain and long-term subsidence along the continental margin, the neutral line being located within the 10 km seaward from the Present coastline. An extensive sequence of raised marine cliffs and associated notches evidences that the most recent uplift step (20\\xad23 ka to Present) along the Cabo Blanco segment is related to a sequence of major earthquakes. We infer that eustacy exerts important feedback coupling to the seismogenic behavior of the North Peru subduction zone. We speculate that during sea level fall, pore fluid pressure diminishes along the subduction channel inducing a possible seaward migration of the locked zone (i.e., migration of the updip limit) reaching a maximum by the end of the eustatic low stand. During eustatic sea level rise, pore fluid pressure increases along the subduction channel. This in turn is capable of weakening the previously locked zone along the plate interface beginning an earthquake sequence. Earth's orbital variations are a potential external cause that may control the physical processes at work along plate interface.                    \",\n",

Land plants evolved from an ancestral charophycean alga from which they inherited developmental, biochemical, and cell biological attributes. Additional biochemical and physiological adaptations to land, and a life cycle with an alternation between multicellular haploid and diploid generations that facilitated efficient dispersal of desiccation tolerant spores, evolved in the ancestral land plant. We analyzed the genome of the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha, a member of a basal land plant lineage. Relative to charophycean algae, land plant genomes are characterized by genes encoding novel biochemical pathways, new phytohormone signaling pathways (notably auxin), expanded repertoires of signaling pathways, and increased diversity in some transcription factor families. Compared with other sequenced land plants, M. polymorpha exhibits low genetic redundancy in most regulatory pathways, with this portion of its genome resembling that predicted for the ancestral land plant.

H2O/OH-bearing phases included 2:1 phyllosilicate(s), bassanite, akaganeite, and amorphous materials. Thermal decomposition of carbonates and combustion of organic materials are candidate sources for the CO2. Concurrent evolution of O2 and chlorinated hydrocarbons suggests the presence of oxychlorine phase(s). Sulfides are likely sources for sulfur-bearing species. Higher abundances of chlorinated hydrocarbons in the mudstone compared with Rocknest windblown materials previously analyzed by Curiosity suggest that indigenous martian or meteoritic organic carbon sources may be preserved in the mudstone; however, the carbon source for the chlorinated hydrocarbons is not definitively of martian origin.

In Japan and South Korea, the TC rise was due to rising HDL cholesterol, which increased by up to 0.17\\u2009mmol/L per decade in Japanese women; in China, it was due to rising non-HDL cholesterol. TC declined in Western countries, except in Polish men. The decline was largest in Finland and Norway, at ∼0.4\\u2009mmol/L per decade. The decline in TC in most Western countries was the net effect of an increase in HDL cholesterol and a decline in non-HDL cholesterol, with the HDL cholesterol increase largest in New Zealand and Switzerland.

Twin studies reveal shared genetic variance between liabilities to eating disorders and substance use, with the strongest associations between symptoms of bulimia nervosa and problem alcohol use (genetic correlation [rg ], twin-based = 0.23-0.53). We estimated the genetic correlation between eating disorder and substance use and disorder phenotypes using data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Four eating disorder phenotypes (anorexia nervosa [AN], AN with binge eating, AN without binge eating, and a bulimia nervosa factor score), and eight substance-use-related phenotypes (drinks per week, alcohol use disorder [AUD], smoking initiation, current smoking, cigarettes per day, nicotine dependence, cannabis initiation, and cannabis use disorder) from eight studies were included. Significant genetic correlations were adjusted for variants associated with major depressive disorder and schizophrenia. Total study sample sizes per phenotype ranged from ~2400 to ~537 000 individuals. We used linkage disequilibrium score regression to calculate single nucleotide polymorphism-based genetic correlations between eating disorder- and substance-use-related phenotypes. Significant positive genetic associations emerged between AUD and AN (rg = 0.18; false discovery rate q = 0.0006), cannabis initiation and AN (rg = 0.23; q < 0.0001), and cannabis initiation and AN with binge eating (rg = 0.27; q = 0.0016). Conversely, significant negative genetic correlations were observed between three nondiagnostic smoking phenotypes (smoking initiation, current smoking, and cigarettes per day) and AN without binge eating (rgs = -0.19 to -0.23; qs < 0.04). The genetic correlation between AUD and AN was no longer significant after co-varying for major depressive disorder loci. The patterns of association between eating disorder- and substance-use-related phenotypes highlights the potentially complex and substance-specific relationships among these behaviors.

This latter stage consists in remapping the variables necessary to the next computation step. Transport of nodal variables is carried out relatively simply by using an upwind technique.

We have recently demonstrated that it was possible to isolate cancer cells adapted to growth in the continuous presence of lovastatin. These cells grew more slowly than the statin-sensitive cells of origin. In the present study, we compared the ability of both statin-sensitive and statin-resistant cells to give rise to tumours in Nude mice. METHODS: HGT-1 human gastric cancer cells and L50 statin-resistant derivatives were injected subcutaneously into Nude mice and tumour growth was recorded. At the end of the experiment, tumours were recovered and marker proteins were analyzed by western blotting, RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: L50 tumours grew more slowly, showed a strong decrease in cyclin B1, over-expressed collagen IV, and had reduced laminin 332, VEGF and CD34 levels, which, collectively, may have restricted cell division, cell adhesion and neoangiogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results showed that statin-resistant cells developed into smaller tumours than statin-sensitive cells. This may be reflective of the cancer restricting activity of statins in humans, as suggested from several retrospective studies with subjects undergoing statin therapy for several years.

On the other hand, CT and MR scans have increased the accuracy of diagnostic procedures and reduced the need for autopsy. However, medical autopsy remains of interest in the case of unexplained sudden death. Recently, postmortem computed tomography (CT) has emerged as an appealing alternative and compared favourably with conventional autopsy [1]. However, because of blood flow cessation, confirmation of diagnosis based on vascular opacification remains difficult. Recent advances in forensic medicine have prompted implementation of new protocols and use of a modified heart lung machine which temporarily restores blood flow and allows diagnosis of vascular pathologies.

Unlike previous model-based approaches using skeletons, we embed the deformation of a reference mesh template within a low polygonal representation of the mesh, namely the cage, using Green Coordinates. The advantage is a less constrained model that more robustly adapts to noisy observations while still providing structured motion information, as required by several applications. The cage is parameterized with a set of 3D features dedicated to the description of human morphology. This allows to formalize a novel representation of 3D meshed and articulated characters, the Oriented Quads Rigging (OQR). To regularize the tracking, the OQR space is subsequently constrained to plausible poses using manifold learning. Results are shown for sequences of meshes, with and without temporal coherence, obtained from multiple view videos preprocessed by visual hull. Motion recovery applications are illustrated with a motion transfer encoding and the extraction of trajectories of anatomical joints.

       " '\\nAbstract : A finite element model of three-dimensional high speed machining is developed. In order to catch Adiabatic Shear Band (ASB), which is about few microns wide, the simulation uses mesh adaptation triggered by an isotropic error estimator. An enhanced version of the Zienkiewicz and Booromand REP in Patches technique is used. As ASB is a much localized phenomenon, the adaptive procedure provides highly refined meshes with strong gradients of the element size, which makes it quite difficult to produce satisfactory 3D meshes. Furthermore, high speed machining leads to very important values of strain rate, deformation and possibly to extreme mesh distortion. So, an Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) method is employed. With the utilized splitting method and linear finite element interpolation, the transport of nodal variables is based on the gradient calculated in the upwind element. For variables stored at the integration points, a remapping procedure using patch recovery techniques is preferred. Finally, because of the very strong thermo-mechanical coupling taking place in ASB, several thermo-mechanical coupling schemes are studied. Explicit and fully implicit schemes are compared, showing that the second one offers a stabilizing effect and a better accuracy. All of these ingredients provide a fully automatic and process independent procedure which allows detecting and following the formation of Adiabatic Shear Band in High Speed Machining. The creation of 3D segmented chip is observed and compared to 2D reference results obtained by Baker in [1]. The influence of numerical coefficients like the mesh size is investigated.

During the study, all participants performed monthly 3 non-consecutive 24-h dietary recalls: this allowed for measuring changes in number-of-serving per day and serving size for each targeted food categories throughout the intervention. Results: Modeling analyses showed that targeting only the 10 main foods contributing to fat and carbohydrate intakes did not allow for reaching the ELPAS nutritional goals. As a result it was decided to target more foods and to propose several types of dietary advice (change in serving size, change in cooking method, food substitution). This strategy led to many appropriate dietary changes during the intervention, but only a few of them reached significance. The mean number-of-serving per day was indeed significantly modified for only 7% of targeted food categories in children and 17% in parents. Mean serving size was modified for only 12% of targeted food categories in children and 9% in parents. Conclusion: The cumulative effect of small dietary changes may induce significant nutritional improvements, with limited burden for populations.                    ',\n",
       " '\\nAbstract : This work reports an experimental study of the kinetics and mechanisms of gelation of carbon nanotubes (CNTs)−hyaluronic acid (HA) mixtures. These materials are of great interest as functional biogels for future medical applications and tissue engineering. We show that CNTs can induce the gelation of noncovalently modified HA in water. This gelation is associated with a dynamical arrest of a liquid crystal phase separation, as shown by small-angle light scattering and polarized optical microscopy. This phenomenon is reminiscent of arrested phase separations in other colloidal systems in the presence of attractive interactions. The gelation time is found to strongly vary with the concentrations of both HA and CNTs. Near-infrared photoluminescence reveals that the CNTs remain individualized both in fluid and in gel states. It is concluded that the attractive forces interplay are likely weak depletion interactions and not strong van der Waals interactions which could promote CNT rebundling, as observed in other biopolymer−CNT mixtures. The present results clarify the remarkable efficiency of CNT at inducing the gelation of HA, by considering that CNTs easily phase separate as liquid crystals because of their giant aspect ratio.

This pathway contains a number of potential targets, including some that have been identified only recently and have yet to be explored. One such target, FadD32, is required for activation of the long meromy-colic chain and is essential for mycobacterial growth. We report here an in-depth biochemical, biophysical, and structural characterization of four FadD32 orthologs, including the very homo-logous enzymes from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Myco-bacterium marinum. Determination of the structures of two complexes with alkyl adenylate inhibitors has provided direct information, with unprecedented detail, about the active site of the enzyme and the associated hydrophobic tunnel, shedding new light on structure-function relationships and inhibition mechanisms by alkyl adenylates and diarylated coumarins.

Tools allowing designers to deal with issues and specifications of the machining domain are taken into account. The main objective of the current work is to prevent designers from designing solutions that would be expensive and difficult to machine. Among all available solutions to achieve this goal, two are distinguished: the generative approach and the analogy approach. The generative approach is more adapted to generate the machining plans of parts composed of numerous boring operations in interaction. However, generative systems have two major problems: proposed solutions are often too numerous and are only geometrically but not technologically relevant. In order to overcome these drawbacks, two new concepts of feature and three control algorithms are developed. The paper presents the two new features: the Machining Enabled Geometrical Feature (MEGF) and the Machinable Features (MbF). This development is the result of the separation of the geometrical and the technological data contained in one machining feature. The second objective of the paper is to improve the current Process Ascending Generation (PAG) system with control algorithms in order to limit the combinatorial explosion and disable the generation of unusable or not machinable solutions.

       " '\\nAbstract : Energy saving has become a real issue in process management and has led to the analysis of the energy consumption of forging machines, for the purpose of optimization. This study focuses on the amount of energy lost due to machine behaviour during the forming process. A spring-mass-damping model of the machine and tools system is associated with a billet model to describe hammer-forming operations only during the forging phase. Themodel parameters are identifiedwith experimental measurements of process variables during a stroke, providing parameters specifically adapted to the machine-tools system. Then, model predictions are validated by the experimental upsetting of steel and aluminium billets. The model accurately predicts forging process variables for consecutive blows with different materials. The decrease in process efficiency and the evolution from inelastic to elastic blows after several strokes on the same billet are also predicted by the model. This methodology provides a new, tailored solution that enables forging manufacturers to predict the forging energy consumption of their own machines. The approach developed in this work concerns gravity drop hammers but is also transferable to other energy-driven machines.                    ',\n",

       " '\\nAbstract : The effects of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4) induced oxidative stress in rats were determined by the generation of isoprostanoids. These are known to be robust biomarkers to evaluate nonenzymatic and free radical related oxidation. Other oxidative stress biomarkers such as hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid products (HETEs) and cholesterol oxidation products (COPs) were also determined. The rodents received a control diet, high-fat diet (20% w/w) composed of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), corn oil (CO), or lard, and high-fat diets with CCl 4 insult throughout the experimental period. The EVOO diet was found to suppress the formation of isoprostanoids and COPs compared to that of the control. EVOO also had a high total phenolic content and antioxidant activity compared to those of CO and lard and may be contributed to by the hydroxytyrosol component conjugated to fatty acids (HT-FA). This is the first study to identify HT-FA in EVOO, and it was 4-fold higher than that of olive oil, whereas none was found in corn oil. Furthermore, the EVOO diet showed reduced liver lipid vesicles in CCl 4 treated rats compared to that of the control. However, liver toxicity measurements of AST (aspartate transaminase) and ALT (alanine transaminase) activities showed augmentation with CCl 4 treatment but were not alleviated by the diets given. Our findings suggest that EVOO is a daily functional food capable of enhancing the antioxidant system for liver protection; the effect is potentially attributed to the phenolic and lipophenolic (phenol conjugated by fatty acids) content.

In the triathletes, a decrease of the lipid peroxidation markers after ACJ intake, associated with neuronal membrane degradation (10-epi-10-F 4t-neuroprostane and 10-F 4t-neuroprostane), was observed when compared with placebo stage values. Regarding the F 2-dihomo-isoprostanes, a significant decrease of the neuromotor system damage biomarkers (17-F 2t-dihomo-isoprostane) with an increase of training load during the study was observed, although the decrease of the load training at the last stage showed a significant increase of the values of ent-7-(RS)-7-F 2t-dihomo-IsoP, suggesting a possible role in adaptation post-training. On the other hand, the changes in the excretion of 17-epi-17-F 2t-dihomo-IsoP provided a positive connection between physical exercise and ACJ intake. Thus, the results showed in this clinical study in young triathletes will help to elucidate novel interactions and mechanisms between the excretion of lipid peroxidation metabolites from CNS, supplementation of polyphenols-rich juice in the diet and physical exercise during a training season.

Besides poly-phenols, melatonin (MEL) and hydroxytyrosol (OHTyr) could be partly responsible for the antioxidant benefits of red wine (excluding colon derivatives). In order to elucidate whether these compounds are responsible for the protective antioxidant effects of red wine, a double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled in vivo study-involving the intake of red wines and their native musts by healthy volunteers-was performed. The urinary metabolites decreased after the administration of red wines, to a greater extent than after the intake of their corresponding musts or ethanol. Melatonin is the most effective compound that protects adrenic acid from oxidative attack, judged by the reduction in the formation of F 2-dihomo-isoprostanes. Similarly, hydroxytyrosol, being the most effective bioactive compound in reducing the formation of F 3-neuroprostanes n-6 DPA and F 4-neuroprostanes, protected docosahexaenoic and eicosapentaenoic acids from oxidative attack.

Moreover, isoprostanes have been established as general and reliable in vivo oxidative stress biomarkers. Red wine has proved to exert several benefits through the maintenance of the oxidative balance of the organism. Antiradical scavenging capacity has been mainly attributed to polyphenols. However, melatonin and hydroxytyrosol should be taken into account as potent antiradical agents. The present research aimed to clarify the situation of enzymatic and oxidative injury and eicosanoid urinary excretion related to the intake of three kinds of red wines and their primary musts. Judging by the reduction in the excretion of isoprostanes, red wine consumption exhibited the highest antioxidant protection against oxidative stress, attributed to its OHTyr content (p < 0.05), and to a lesser extent to its MEL content. Similarly, the intake of red wine leads to the cardioprotective effect due to the reduction in the urinary excretion of the pro-inflammatory prostaglan-din 2,3-dinor-11-β-PGF 2α , besides the increase in the vasodilator prostaglandin PGE 1 , mediated by the melatonin (p < 0.05) and hydroxytyrosol (p < 0.05) contents.

On the one hand, we found a significant, positive correlation (Rho: 0.197, P=0.015) between the age increase and the amount of total F 2-dihomo-IsoPs. On the other hand, the values were significantly higher in the childhood group (4-12 years old), when compared to the adolescence group (13-17 years old) and the young adult group (18-35 years old).

Time-lapse studies using conventional imaging require enzyme labeling and following the biochemical modifications of biopolymers found in plant cell walls, which cannot be easily achieved. In the present work, synchrotron facilities have been used to image the enzymatic degradation of lignocellulosic biomass without labeling the enzyme or the cell walls. Multichannel autofluorescence imaging of the protein and phenolic compounds after excitation at 275 nm highlighted the presence or absence of enzymes on cell walls and made it possible to track them during the reaction. Image analysis was used to quantify the fluorescence intensity variations. Consistent variations in the enzyme concentration were found locally for cell cavities and their surrounding cell walls. Microfluidic FT-IR microspectroscopy allowed for time-lapse tracking of local changes in the polysaccharides in cell walls during degradation. Hemicellulose degradation was found to occur prior to cellulose degradation using a Celluclast (R) preparation. Combining the fluorescence and FT-IR information yielded the conclusion that enzymes did not bind to lignified cell walls, which were consequently not degraded. Fluorescence multiscale imaging and FT-IR microspectroscopy showed an unexpected variability both in the initial biochemical composition and the degradation pattern, highlighting micro-domains in the cell wall of a given cell. Fluorescence intensity quantification showed that the enzymes were not evenly distributed, and their amount increased progressively on degradable cell walls. During degradation, adjacent cells were separated and the cell wall fragmented until complete degradation.                    ',\n",

COSs with polymerization degrees (DPs) of 5, 10, 15, and 20 were obtained by nitrous acid deamination. A complete study on depolymerization and precise product and side product characterization was undergone. Chemical modification of COSs was performed to achieve amphiphilic structures using three fatty epoxides with a growing chain length butyl (C4), octadecyl (C9), and hexadecyl glycidyl ether (C16)). The grafting efficiency according to reaction conditions was established. Different substitution degrees (DSs) were obtained by modulating the ratio of fatty epoxy to NH2. It was shown that after a certain DS, the oligomers thus formed were not water-soluble anymore. At the end, cardanol glycidyl ether was grafted on DP 5, 10, and 15 COSs, cardanol being a biobased compound extracted from cashew nut shell; this reaction led to a potentially fully biobased structure. Water-soluble candidates with a higher DS were used as surfactants to emulsify motor oil as a simulation of bitumen. Cardanol–chitosan-based surfactants led to direct oil-in-water emulsion (60/40 w/w) composed of particles of 15 μm average size that were stable at least for 24 h.                    ',\n",

Lipid peroxidation compounds were determined in urine using a validated analytical method based on liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Statistical studies consisted of the evaluation of two different linear (Elastic Net) and non-linear (Random Forest) regression models to discriminate between groups of participants. The regression models fitted to the data from some lipid peroxidation biomarkers (isoprostanes, neuroprostanes, prostaglandines, dihomo-isoprostanes) in urine as potential predictors of early AD. these prediction models achieved fair validated area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUc-Rocs > 0.68) and their results corroborated each other since they are based on different analytical principles.

When fed to rodents, ALA and eicosapentaenoic acid levels increased in the liver and heart tissues compared to the control diet. Furthermore, phytoprostanes and phytofurans were elevated 3fold in both tissues after a walnut diet, indicating that they are not only contributed from the diet but also generated through in vivo autoxidation of ALA found in the walnuts. It was further noted that a walnut diet reduced 5-F 2t-isoprostanes and 12hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and induced 4-F 4t-neuroprostane and significant amounts of anti-inflammatory hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid in the liver only.

The variables affecting the UA-LLsME efficiency were systematically studied. Under the optimum conditions, the methodology was validated and showed high-throughput, high sensitivity (limits of detection 0.02-2 nmol L −1), and satisfactory precision (coef-ficients of variation 2-11% (intra-day) and 5-12% (inter-day)). The reliability of the described method was assessed analysing spiked saliva samples, and the recoveries were between 80% and 120% for most of the analytes. Then, the method suitability was demonstrated by analysing saliva samples (n = 30) from elderly people with neurodegenerative diseases. To conclude, the new developed analytical method is a useful tool to determine salivary lipid peroxidation compounds as potential biomarkers in further clinical studies in which oxidative stress plays an important role.                    \",\n",

       " '\\nAbstract : The European directive 2006/42/CE promulgates the machine safe design principles to prevent professional risks. However, outside machines that have specific safety standards, the designers of special machines and manufacturing systems can only use generic safety standards, limiting as a consequence the results of hazards detection. The aim of this paper is to present an original approach for this detection during the design of working equipment. We based our study on a hypothesis of the literature that links hazards to the presence of energy flows. Thus, the hazards detection is reduced to the study of the building of energy flows and the detection of potential links between these flows and the operator. Thanks to such data, the designer will be able to select the best risk prevention solutions. To reach this goal, we decided to use the Functional Energetic Model (FEMo) to model the technical system and its energy flows. This choice was made because this model was developed for the design of technical systems integrating different types of energy. By using this modelling, the designer can easily analyses every potential interactions between the energy flows and the operator, depending on the future working situations in each life cycle phases. Our approach builds on this model all along the design process, allowing the designer to early detect hazards and to apply at the best moment the risk prevention solutions. We present the application of this approach during the design of a working equipment, since the definition of the raw need. We confirm that its application and the system modelling in the EFM formalism are possible since the conceptual design phase. Data from the next design phases enrich the model, and consequently improve the detection and characterization of hazards.                    ',\n",

       " \"\\nAbstract : Reactivation of latent M tuberculosis (Mtb) infection is a major complication of anti-TNFalpha treatment, but its mechanism is not fully understood. In this work, we evaluated in two conditions the effect of the TNF antagonists infliximab, adalimumab and etanercept on anti-mycobacterial immune responses: with ex vivo studies from patients treated with TNF antagonists, and with the in vitro addition of TNF antagonists to cells stimulated with mycobacteria antigens. In both cases, we analysed the response of CD4+ T lymphocytes to PPD and to CFP-10, an antigen restricted to Mtb. The tests performed were lymphoproliferation and immediate production of IFNgamma (ELISPOT). In the 68 patients with inflammatory diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, spondylarthropathy or Crohn's disease), including 31 patients with a previous or latent tuberculosis (TB), fourteen weeks of anti-TNFalpha treatment had no effect on the proliferation of CD4+ T lymphocytes. In contrast, the number of IFNgamma-releasing CD4+ T lymphocytes decreased, for PPD (p<0.005) and CFP-10 (p<0.01), in patients with previous TB, and for PPD (p<0.05) in other patients (all vaccinated with Bacille Calmette-Guerin). Treatments with infliximab and with etanercept affected IFNgamma release to a similar extent. In vitro addition of TNF antagonists to CD4+T lymphocytes stimulated with mycobacteria antigens inhibited their proliferation and their expression of membrane-bound TNF (mTNF). These effects occurred late in cultures, suggesting a direct effect of TNF antagonists on activated mTNF+ CD4+ T lymphocytes. Infliximab and adalimumab were more efficient than etanercept for these in vitro effects. Therefore, TNF antagonists have a dual action on anti-mycobacteria CD4+ T lymphocytes. Administered in vivo, they decrease the frequency of the subpopulation of anti-mycobacteria memory CD4+ T lymphocytes rapidly releasing IFNgamma upon challenge with mycobacteria antigens. All TNF antagonists are as efficient to induce this decline. Added in vitro, they inhibit the activation of CD4+ T lymphocytes by mycobacteria antigens, with a stronger effect of infliximab and adalimumab than of etanercept. Such a dual effect may explain the increased incidence of TB in patients treated with TNF antagonists as well as possible differences between TNF antagonists for the incidence and the clinical presentation of TB reactivation.                    \",\n",

The study is limited firstly to the cylinders. For the optimization, two main types of surfaces modelling are considered: difference surface-based method and real model.

In a reconfigurable manufacturing environment, basic modules can be rearranged, interchanged, or modified, to adjust the production capacity according to production requirements. Reconfigurable machine tools have modular structure comprising of basic and auxiliary modules that aid in modifying the functionality of a manufacturing system. As the product’s design and its manufacturing capabilities are closely related, the manufacturing system is desired to be customizable to cater for all the design changes. Moreover, the performance of a manufacturing system lies in a set of planning and scheduling data incorporated with the machining capabilities keeping in view the market demands. This research work is based on the co-evolution of process planning and machine configurations in which optimal machine capabilities are generated through the application of multi-objective genetic algorithms. Furthermore, based on these capabilities, the system is tested for reconfiguration in case of production changeovers. Since, in a reconfigurable environment, the same machine can be used to perform different tasks depending on the required configuration, the subject research work assigns optimum number of machines by minimizing the machining capabilities to carry out different operations in order to streamline production responses. An algorithm has also been developed and verified on a part family. As a result of the proposed methodology, an optimized reconfigurable framework can be achieved to realize optimal production of a part family. Finally, the proposed methodology was applied on a case study and respective conclusions were drawn.                    ',\n",

       " '\\nAbstract : The statistical tolerance analysis has become a key element used in the design stage to reduce the manufacturing cost, the rejection rate and to have high quality products. One of the frequently used methods is the Monte Carlo simulation, employed to compute the non-conformity rate due to its efficiency in handling the tolerance analysis of over-constrained mechanical systems. However, this simulation technique requires excessive numerical efforts. The goal of this paper is to improve this method by proposing a probabilistic model of gaps in fixed and sliding contacts and involved in the tolerance analysis of an assembly. The probabilistic model is carried out on the clearance components of the sliding and fixed contacts for their assembly feasibility considering all the imperfections on the surfaces. The kernel density estimation method is used to deal with the probabilistic model. The proposed method is applied to an over-constrained mechanical system and compared to the classical method regarding their computation time.                    ',\n",
       " '\\nAbstract : During the design stage of product manufacturing, the designers try to specify only the necessary critical dimensions or what is called “Key Characteristics”. Knowing that dealing with Key Characteristics is time consuming and costly, it is preferable to reduce their number and exclude the non-contributing parameters. Different strategies that are based on qualitative or quantitative approaches for the identification of these dimensions are followed by the companies. The common way is to define the critical functional requirements which are expressed in terms of dimensions. When the functional requirements are set as critical, all the involved dimensions are labelled as Key Characteristics. However they do not have the same importance and need to be classified between contributing and non-contributing parameters. There is not a quantitative method that serves for the identification of Key Characteristics in the critical functional requirements. This paper suggests a numerical methodology which can be a step forward to a better ranking of the Key Characteristics. It is based on the global sensitivity analysis and more precisely on Sobol’ approach. The sensitivity of the Non Conformity Rate corresponding to the production of the product is measured with respect to the variable parameters characterizing the dimensions. The method is applied, first on a simple two-part example, then on a system having a linearised functional requirement and finally on a system with two non-linear functional requirements. The results show the main effects of the dimensions in addition to their interactions. Consequently it is possible to prioritize some and neglect the effect of the others and classify them respectively as Key Characteristics or not.                    ',\n",

The relative position between any two surfaces of a mechanism is determined by operations (Minkowski sum and intersection) on these polyhedrons. The polyhedrons are generally unbounded due to the inclusion of degrees of invariance for surfaces and degrees of freedom for joints defining theoretically unlimited displacements.In a first part are introduced the cap half-spaces to limit these displacements in order to transform the polyhedron into polytopes. This method requires controlling the influence of these additional half-spaces on the topology of calculated polytopes. This is necessary to ensure the traceability of these half-spaces through the tolerancing analysis process.A second part provides an inventory of the issues related to the numerical implementation of polytopes. One of them depends on the choice of a computation configuration (expression point and base, homogenization coefficients) to define a polytope. After proving that the modification of a computation configuration is an affine transformation, several simulation strategies are listed in order to understand the problems of numerical precision and computation time.

Defect limits can be modelled by tolerance zones constructed by offsets on nominal models of parts. Cumulative defect limits can be modelled using a calculated polytope, the result of a set of intersections and Minkowski sums of polytopes. A functional requirement can be qualified by a functional polytope, in other words a target polytope. It is then necessary to verify whether the calculated polytope is included in the functional polytope. The purpose of this article is to determine the Minkowski sum of 3-dimension polytopes and apply this effectively in order to optimise the filling of the functional polytope. This method can be used to determine from which vertices of the operands the vertices of the Minkowski sum derive. It is also possible to determine to which facets of the operands each facet of the Minkowski sum is oriented. First, the main properties of the duality of normal cones and primal cones associated with the vertices of a polytope are described. Next, the properties of normal fans are applied to define the vertices and facets of the Minkowski sum of two polytopes. An algorithm is proposed which generalises the method. Lastly, there is a discussion of the features of this algorithm, developed using the OpenCascade environment.                    ',\n",

The angular trajectories describing the gait are generated by cubic splines functions. The gait is composed of single support phase followed by an impact.

The cyclic gait is given by a succession of Single Support Phase (SSP) followed by an impact. The gait trajectories are parameterized by cubic spline functions. The energetic criterion is minimized through optimization while using the simplex algorithm and Lagrange penalty functions to meet the constraints of stability and deflection of the mobile foot.

       " '\\nAbstract : The design of humanoid robots has been a tricky challenge for several years. Due to the kinematic complexity of human joints, their movements are notoriously difficult to be reproduced by a mechanism. The human knees allow movements including rolling and sliding, and therefore the design of new bioinspired knees is of utmost importance for the reproduction of anthropomorphic walking in the sagittal plane. In this article, the kinematic characteristics of knees were analyzed and a mechanical solution for reproducing them is proposed. The geometrical, kinematic and dynamic models are built together with an impact model for a biped robot with the new knee kinematic. The walking gait is studied as a problem of parametric optimization under constraints. The trajectories of walking are approximated by mathematical functions for a gait composed of single support phases with impacts. Energy criteria allow comparing the robot provided with the new rolling knee mechanism and a robot equipped with revolute knee joints. The results of the optimizations show that the rolling knee brings a decrease of the sthenic criterion. The comparisons of torques are also observed to show the difference of energy distribution between the actuators. For the same actuator selection, these results prove that the robot with rolling knees can walk longer than the robot with revolute joint knees.                    ',\n",

In order to increase parallelism, expressions are reparsed implicitly using mathematical laws like associativity and this reduces the accuracy. Our approach consists in performing an exhaustive study: we generate all the algorithms equivalent to the original one and compatible with our relaxed time constraint. Next we compute the worst errors which may arise during their evaluation, for several relevant sets of data. Our main conclusion is that relaxing very slightly the time constraints by choosing algorithms whose critical paths are a bit longer than the optimal makes it possible to strongly optimize the accuracy.

To validate the modelling and the simulation, it is important to get various experimental informations during the test and to correlate them with simulated results. In a previous paper (Becker et al, 2008), the macro and micro structure obtained for different process parameters during thixoextrusion of C38 were investigated. In this work, those results are correlated to those obtained by simulations of the processing. The constitutive equation of the material is given by a multi-scale modelling based on micromechanics and homogenization techniques, labelled as micro-macro modelling (Favier et al, 2009). The parameters of the model are determined (i) using literature results and (ii) to match various experimental measurements obtained during the test and described in Becker et al (2008) such as the die temperature during the test and the load-displacement curve. Comparisons between experimental and simulated reveal the presence of complex temperature field and the presence of zones having very low viscosities. These zones contribute actively to the semi-solid material flow.                    ',\n",

The technological, economic, and logistic parameters are taken into account simultaneously as well as manufacturing constraints being integrated into the product design. As a consequence, the most feasible alternative with regard to the product's detailed design is extracted satisfying the product's functional requirements. Subsequently, a couple of conceptual process plans are proposed relied on manufacturing processes being preliminarily selected in the conceptual design phase. Virtual manufacturing is employed under CAM software to simulate fabrication process of the potential process plans. Ultimately, the most suitable process plan for fabricating the part is recommended based upon a multi-criteria analysis as a resolution for decision making.                    \",\n",

Dans le cas des alliages d’aluminium, ceci offre de grandes possibilités comme le soudage des alliages des séries 2000 (Al-Cu) et 7000 (Al-Zn) ainsi que les alliages de fonderie.

The interface presents the form of wavelets with a period of 1000 µm and an amplitude of 250 µm. The superalloy grains are deformed during the cladding process with several slip systems appearing. Near to the interface, the superalloy grains elongate and tend to follow the geometry of the interface. Observation with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) reveals zones of localised fusion at the interface. The EDS analysis shows that these fusion zones are the result of mixing between the base and cladding plates. Radiocrystallographic analysis by X-ray diffraction reveals the presence of the f.c.c cobalt in the cobalt-based superalloy layer. Thus cobalt retains its crystallographic structure (f.c.c) after cladding process. Hardness is evaluated with reference to microstructure. Near the interface, the hardness of the superalloy is of the order of 600 HV1 kg. In the remainder of the thickness, hardness is of the order of 500 HV1 kg, being greater than that of the unplated superalloy (270 HV1 kg).

Moreover, burning behavior of samples were captured on a digital camera to give a deeper sense of their flammability character for comparison. The results revealed a significant improvement of flammability and thermal stability of composites, particularly in the presence of sepiolite with respect to the value obtained for unfilled PHB. Regarding TGA results, the char residue yield was increased to ca. 20.0 wt.% in the presence of sepiolite, while 0.0 wt.% was observed for PHB. PCFC measurements uncovered higher performance of PHB-Sep. sample as signaled by 40% reduction in the peak of heat release rate with respect to PHB. According to observations, PHB-Sep. sample showed non-dripping behavior with high capacity of charring in the presence of Sep. in vertical flame test.                    ',\n",
       " '\\nAbstract : Cross wedge rolling (CWR) is a metal forming process used in the automotive industry. One of its applications is in the manufacturing process of connecting rods. CWR transforms a cylindrical billet into a complex axisymmetrical shape with an accurate distribution of material. This preform is forged into shape in a forging die. In order to improve CWR tool lifecycle and product quality it is essential to understand tool wear evolution and the physical phenomena that change on the CWR process due to the resulting geometry of the tool when undergoing tool wear. In order to understand CWR tool wear behavior, numerical simulations are necessary. Nevertheless, if the simulations are performed with the CAD geometry of the tool, results are limited. To solve this difficulty, two numerical simulations with FORGE® were performed using the real geometry of the tools (both up and lower roll) at two different states: (1) before starting lifecycle and (2) end of lifecycle. The tools were 3D measured with ATOS triple scan by GOM® using optical 3D measuring techniques. The result was a high-resolution point cloud of the entire geometry of the tool. Each 3D point cloud was digitalized and converted into a STL format. The geometry of the tools in a STL format was input for the 3D simulations. Both simulations were compared. Defects of products obtained in simulation were compared to main defects of products found industrially. Two main defects are: (a) surface defects on the preform that are not fixed in the die forging operation; and (b) Preform bent (no longer straight), with two possible impacts: on the one hand that the robot cannot grab it to take it to the forging stage; on the other hand, an unfilled section in the forging operation.

       " '\\nAbstract : Semi-solid forming is an effective near-net-shape forming process to produce components with complex geometry and in fewer forming steps. It benefits from the complex thixotropic behaviour of semi-solids. However, the consequences of such behaviour on the flow during thixoforming, is still neither completely characterized and nor fully understood, especially for high melting point alloys. The study described in this paper investigates thixoextrusion for C38 low carbon steel material using dies at temperatures much lower than the slug temperature. Four different process parameters were studied: the initial slug temperature, the die temperature, the ram speed and the presence of a ceramic layer at the tool/material interface. The extruded parts were found to have an exact shape and a good surface state only if the temperature was below a certain value. This critical temperature is not an intrinsic material property since its value depends on die temperature and the presence of the Ceraspray©layer. Two kinds of flow were highlighted: a homogeneous flow controlled by the behaviour of the solid skeleton characterized by a positive strain rate sensitivity, and a non homogeneous flow (macro liquid/solid phase separation) dominated by the flow of the free liquid. With decreasing ram speed, heat losses increase so that the overall consistency of the material improves, leading to apparent negative strain rate sensitivity. Finally, some ways to optimise thixoforming are proposed.                    ',\n",

Ce procédé intéresse les utilisateurs d'alliages légers car, sans passer par la fusion, il permet le soudage d'alliages à haute résistance, jusque là inutilisables en raison de leur soudabilité difficile avec les procédés traditionnels.

The PRALIMAP-INÈS trial aimed to investigate whether a strengthened-care management for adolescents with low socioeconomic status has an equivalent effect in preventing and reducing overweight as a standard-care management for high socioeconomic status adolescents. Methods: PRALIMAP-INÈS was a mixed, prospective and multicenter trial including 35 state-run schools. It admitted overweight or obese adolescents, age 13-18 years old, for 3 consecutive academic years. One-year interventions were implemented. Data were collected before (T0), after (T1) and post (T2) intervention. Among 2113 eligible adolescents who completed questionnaires, 1639 were proposed for inclusion and 1419 were included (220 parental refusals). Two groups were constituted according to the Family Affluence Scale (FAS) score: the less advantaged (FAS≤5) were randomly assigned to 2 groups in a 2/1 ratio. The 3 intervention groups were: advantaged with standard-care management (A.S, n = 808), less advantaged with standard-care management (LA.S, n = 196), and less advantaged with standard and strengthened-care management (LA.S.S, n = 415). The standard-care management was based on the patient education principle and consisted of 5 collective sessions. The strengthened-care management was based on the proportionate universalism principle and consisted of activities adapted to needs. Inclusion results: The written parental refusal was less frequent among less advantaged and more overweight adolescents. A dramatic linear social gradient in overweight was evidenced. Discussion: The PRALIMAP-INÈS outcomes should inform how effectively a socially adapted public health program can avoid worsening social inequalities in overweight adolescents attending school.

       " '\\nAbstract : Knee arthroplasty is widely used nowadays and concerns younger and younger patients. Gonarthrosis, i.e. knee arthrosis, is the most common indication for arthroplasty. The angular alteration of the leg alignment (gonometry) is quantified by means of frontal X-rays analysis allowing for surgical planning. Previously published studies show that this analysis restricted to the frontal plane is far from being the optimum one. The present study is based on an existing technique: three dimensional reconstruction of the knee from stereoradiography. In order to tranfer this new technique in routine clinical practice, we defined and evaluated a series of measurement and analysis tools, allowing for a three dimensional quantification of the evolution of the leg alignment alterations pre-, per- and post-operatively. The results show that the knee three dimensional reconstruction protocol from stereoradiography may be used in clinical practice. The inter observer mean reproducibility error is less than 1 mm for the femur and tibia morphometry. As for the 3D morphology, for 95 % of the test, the error is inferior or equal to 1.6°, except for a few measurements based on hardly identifiable anatomical landmarks. 14 arthroplasties have been done with the computer navigation system. This system has allowed the surgeon to follow and to determine axial alignment during surgery, the navigation remains a interoperative measurement tool. Finally, the present study also provides three dimensional postoperative gonometry from stereoradiography. A pre-, per-, postoperative three dimensional analysis protocol is now available for the quantification of the leg alignment alterations and was evaluated in a clinical environment on pathologic knees.

       " '\\nAbstract : The microstructure plays a crucial role for steel semi-solid forming process, and\\r\\nparticularly for the steel thixoforging process, since it determines the thixotropic flow behavior of materials in the semi-solid state. Therefore, it is necessary to well understand the microstructure evolution during high speed heating and forming. Classically, it is investigated on a solid material quenched from semi-solid state by 2D characterization techniques. However, the semi-solid microstructure could probably not be preserved in the solid state by quenching due to complicated phase transformations or high diffusion rate of alloying elements during cooling, especially at low liquid fractions. In order to avoid this, a new in situ technique - high temperature Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM) - was developed and used for studying the microstructure evolution directly at high temperature. The present study aims at providing an experimental investigation of the microstructure evolution on several steel grades (M2, 100Cr6 and C38LTT) during heating from the as-received state to the semi-solid state (heating rate: ~200°C/min) and finally cooled to the solid state (cooling rate: ~200°C/min). It has been found that the temperature sensitivity of liquid fraction (ΔT/ Δfl) of these grades is much\\r\\ndifferent. In addition, during cooling, there is a significant difference in diffusion rate of alloying elements between these grades. In M2, thanks to the high content of alloying elements and their low diffusion rate, the semi-solid temperature range is greater and its microstructure in the semi-solid state could be preserved by quenching process or even at a low cooling rate. On the contrary, the microstructure of other steel grades 100Cr6 and C38LTT in semi-solid state can only be revealed by CLSM at high temperature, because of the lower volume fraction of alloying elements and their high diffusion rate. It is very interesting to use high temperature CLSM to in situ investigate the microstructure evolution in the semi-solid state, especially at low liquid fraction. Since the microstructure of M2 in the semi-solid state can be reserved after cooling, it is possible to identify liquid area by the post-mortem examination. Therefore, the material flow behavior of thixoforged parts could be investigated.                    ',\n",

Currently, the regulation of LCT gene expression remains poorly known. Peroxisome proliferator activator receptorγ (PPARγ) is a key player in carbohydrate metabolism. While the intestine is essential for carbohydrate digestion and absorption, the role of PPARγ in enterocyte metabolic functions has been poorly investigated. This study aims at characterizing PPARγ target genes involved in intestinal metabolic functions. In microarray analysis, the LCT gene was the most upregulated by PPARγ agonists in Caco‐2 cells. We confirmed that PPARγ agonists were able to increase the expression and activity of LCT both in vitro and in vivo in the proximal small bowel of rodents. The functional response element activated by PPARγ was identified in the promoter of the human LCT gene. PPARγ modulation was able to improve symptoms induced by lactose‐enriched diet in weaned rats. Our results demonstrate that PPARγ regulates LCT expression, and suggest that modulating intestinal PPARγ activity might constitute a new therapeutic strategy for lactose malabsorption.                    \",\n",

These clusters represent groups of similar realizations used to characterize a multidimensional manifold that can be interpolated to assess each new realization of the process behaviour. We evaluated the methodology on the data from a hydroelectric turbine. The event of interest was the loss of the turbine propeller runner cone.

       " \"\\nAbstract : On the gear testing device of the LIS laboratory (Grenoble, France), a total of 20 signals are synchronously recorded including shaft acceleration signals in several positions, torque, rotation speed, optical encoder signal of both shafts and currents and tensions of the non-synchronous training motor. After about 3500 hours of using this device, the driving gear shaft broke at the gear coupling position with the training motor shaft, which created an impressive helicoïdal crack . This failure could be due to a flexion strain caused by a misalignment of the two shafts, but this fault was not detected before. In this paper we compare results of different signal processing methods for the detection of this fault. Particularly, we use the phase spectrogram whose advantage is to be able to highlight a slight phase modulation in signals that is not detectable on the amplitude spectrogram. We also attempt to detect the fault using spectral analysis, a non-stationary modelling based on Prony's model and comparison of signals recorded at different times before the crack: the acceleration signals, the torque, and the torsional vibration signal obtained from the shaft encoder signal. The detection results are compared and discussed between the different methods.                    \",\n",
       " \"\\nAbstract : The effect of phase reference on phase unwrapping and discrete Fourier transform (DFT) phase behavior are first illustrated by z-transform. With the finite sequence z-transform and DFT, the phase is referenced at the first time sample of a N time samples window since the phase value is relative to this time position. With a DFT referenced like that, without a spectral interpolation between frequency lines, a spectral component has one or many line to line pi phase rotations below its main lobe and line to line 2pi phase rotation on the outside: this 2pi rotation appear like a continuous quasi-constant phase line to line. Conversely, a DFT referenced at the window center show a flat phase under a spectral component's main lobe and a pi phase rotation at every spectral line outside the main lobe. This latter phase pattern facilitates phase unwrapping. Moreover, the flat phase section under a main lobe simplifies the search for an optimal phase estimation algorithm with interpolated fast Fourier Transform (IFFT). It has been demonstrated, from the Cramér-Rao bound, that the variance on the phase is minimal at the center of the time window, where it's suggest to put the phase reference for phase parameter estimation. This explain why the high-accuracy estimation algorithm, which we developed, like other algorithms developed by others authors, is not only close to the frequency and amplitude estimation error lower bounds, but also to the phase lower bound for a constant tone when we reference the phase to the window center. ---- This paper has been submitted to an IEEE journal in June 1999.

       " '\\nAbstract : This paper proposes to use a non-linear observer to build the state and the external force of flexible manipulator robots during their machining (composite materials) processes or Friction Stir Welding (FSW) processes. These two different processes have a problem in common: the flexibility of the robot can not be neglected, that is to say, the errors due to the deformation of the links should be taken into account. However, in most industrial robots, the real positions and velocities of each link are not measured, so in this study, an observer is proposed to reconstruct the real angular positions and velocities of links by using the measured angular positions and the velocities of actuators. A simulation by Matlab/Simulink has been carried out with a 2 axis Robot during its machining processes: the proposed observer showed great performances in estimating the state of the robot (position and velocity). Then, in order to improve the tracking accuracy in the tool frame, the state of the external force along the forward direction (x) and its normal direction (y) are required, while they are also not measured by our robot. A disturbance observer has been added to reconstruct the processing force. A good precision during the proposed processes have been obtained using the latter. This study contributes to solve the problem from the point of view of accuracies during the machining processes.                    ',\n",

A high value of ~15% is found at 10 K for the hBN internal quantum yield, almost two orders of magnitude higher than for diamond, although both crystals present indirect bandgaps. The hBN luminescence efficiency remains stable up to room temperature consistently with tightly bound excitons. Ab initio calculations of the exciton dispersion in bulk hBN confirm the lowest-energy exciton is indirect, with a theoretical binding energy equal to 300 meV in agreement with the observed thermal stability of luminescence. The direct exciton is found with a binding energy of 670 meV in good agreement with previous reports. Its energy turns out to be ~100 meV above the indirect one and finally solves the long-standing debate on the Stoke shift in bulk hBN. The benefits of these findings for the understanding of atomic BN layer properties are discussed.                    ',\n",
       " '\\nAbstract : The problem of estimating nonstationary signals has been considered in many previous publications. In this paper we propose an alternative algorithm in order to accurately estimate AM/FM1 signals. Only single component signals are considered. We perform local polynomial modeling on short time segments using a nonsequential strategy. The degree of polynomial approximation is limited due to the shortness of each time segment. The time support of a segment is controlled by a criterion defined on the spectrogram. To keep optimality a maximum likelihood procedure estimates the local model parameters leading to a non linear equation system in R7. This is solved by a Simulated Annealing technique. Finally, the local polynomial models are merged to reconstruct the entire signal model. The proposed algorithm enables highly nonlinear AM/FM estimation and shows robustness even when Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) is low. The appropriate Cramer Rao Bounds (CRB) are presented for both polynomial phase and amplitude signals. Monte Carlo simulations show that the proposed algorithm performs well. Finally, our proposed method is illustrated using both numerical simulations and a real signal of whale sound.                    ',\n",

We consider differentiation with respect to parameters, initial conditions or the time. We emphasize the case of a small number of derivations and iterated differentiations are mostly treated with a foccus on high order iterations of the same derivation. The models we consider may involve arithmetic operations, elementary functions, logical tests but also more elaborate components such as delays, integrators, equations and differential equations solvers. This survey has no pretention to exhaustivity but tries to fil a gap in the litterature where each kind of of component may be documented, but seldom their common use. The general approach is illustrated by computer algebra experiments, stressing the interest of performing differentiation, whenever possible, on high level objects, before any translation in Fortran or C code. We include ordinary differential systems with discontinuity, with a special interest for those comming from discontinuous Lagrangians. We conclude with an overview of the graphic methodology developped in the Diffedge software for Simulink hybrid models. Not all possibilities are covered, but the methodology can be adapted. The result of automatic differentiation is a new block diagram and so it can be easily translated to produce real time embedded programs.

Recommended care is partial endodontic treatment. The dental literature reports major difficulties in achieving adequate analgesia to perform this emergency treatment, especially in the case of mandibular molars. In current practice, short-course, orally administered corticotherapy is used for the management of oral pain of inflammatory origin. The efficacy of intraosseous local steroid injections for irreversible pulpitis in mandibular molars has already been demonstrated but resulted in local comorbidities. Oral administration of short-course prednisolone is simple and safe but its efficacy to manage pain caused by irreversible pulpitis has not yet been demonstrated. This trial aims to evaluate the noninferiority of short-course, orally administered corticotherapy versus partial endodontic treatment for the emergency care of irreversible pulpitis in mandibular molars.Methods/designThis study is a noninferiority, open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial conducted at the Bordeaux University Hospital. One hundred and twenty subjects will be randomized in two 1:1 parallel arms: the intervention arm will receive one oral dose of prednisolone (1\\xa0mg/kg) during the emergency visit, followed by one morning dose each day for 3\\xa0days and the reference arm will receive partial endodontic treatment. Both groups will receive planned complete endodontic treatment 72\\xa0h after enrollment. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients with pain intensity below 5 on a Numeric Scale 24\\xa0h after the emergency visit. Secondary outcomes include comfort during care, the number of injected anesthetic cartridges when performing complete endodontic treatment, the number of antalgic drugs and the number of patients coming back for consultation after 72\\xa0h.DiscussionThis randomized trial will assess the ability of short-term corticotherapy to reduce pain in irreversible pulpitis as a simple and rapid alternative to partial endodontic treatment and to enable planning of endodontic treatment in optimal analgesic conditions.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT02629042.

Several approaches to evaluate system reliability parameters exist today; however, their work is based on the assumptions that hardware and software failures happen independently. The challenge in this field is to take into account the hardware-software interactions in the evaluation of the model. In the continuity of the CETIM project (Belhadaoui et al. 2007) whose principal objective is to define an integrated design of dependable mechatronic systems, this work evaluates important reliability parameters of an embedded application in a stack processor architecture using two dynamic models. The first one (stack processor emulator (Jallouli et al. 2007)) allows the study of dynamic performance and the evaluation of a fault-tolerant technique. The second one (information flow approach (Hamidi et al. 2005)) evaluates the failure probability for each assembler instruction and for some program loops. The main objective is to estimate the failure probability of the whole application. The hierarchically modelling with the information flow approach makes it possible to evaluate the efficiency of protection program loops. These loops ensure the fault tolerance policy by recovering imminent failures and allow the application to run successfully thanks to a permanent software recover mechanism: in case of a detected and not corrected error, the system returns to the last faultless state. This work is useful because it allows adjusting the architecture and shows the advantages of the hardware-software interactions during the co-design phase before the hardware implementation. It puts the hand on the critical points in term of reliability thanks to the scenarios of critical failure paths in the processor architecture.                    ',\n",

To get insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms, we analyzed cortical development in Neurod2 KO mice. Cortical projection neurons (CPNs) over-migrated during embryogenesis, inducing abnormal thickness and laminar positioning of cortical layers. At juvenile ages, dendritic spine turnover and intrinsic excitability were increased in L5 CPNs. Differentially expressed genes in Neurod2 KO mice were enriched for voltage-gated ion channels, and the human orthologs of these genes were strongly associated with ASD. Furthermore, adult Neurod2 KO mice exhibited core ASD-like behavioral abnormalities. Finally, by generating Neurod2 conditional mutant mice we demonstrate that forebrain excitatory neuron-specific Neurod2 deletion recapitulates cellular and behavioral ASD phenotypes found in full KO mice.

In each group (MDA+/MDA−), 2 seeders were placed with 4 piglets in direct contact and 5 in indirect contact (3 replicates per group). Serological kinetics (ELISA) and individual viral shedding (RT-PCR) were monitored for 28\\xa0days after infection. MDA waning was estimated using a nonlinear mixed-effects model and survival analysis. Differential transmission rates were estimated depending on the piglets’ initial serological status and contact structure (direct contact with pen-mates or indirect airborne contact). The time to MDA waning was 71.3 [52.8–92.1] days on average. The airborne transmission rate was 1.41 [0.64–2.63] per day. The compared shedding pattern between groups showed that MDA+ piglets had mainly a reduced susceptibility to infection compared to MDA− piglets. The resulting reproduction number estimated in MDA+ piglets (5.8 [1.4–18.9]), although 3 times lower than in MDA− piglets (14.8 [6.4–27.1]), was significantly higher than 1. Such an efficient and extended spread of swIAV at the population scale in the presence of MDAs could contribute to swIAV persistence on farms, given the fact that the period when transmission is expected to be impacted by the presence of MDAs can last up to 10\\xa0weeks.

However, these simple springs do not allow to take into account non-linearities such as contact with friction. To face this problem, a new macromodel is considered.                    ',\n",
       " '\\nAbstract : In plastic injection mould and prosthesis industries, “mirror-effect” polished surfaces are required for obtaining transparent parts or surfaces without scratches. Traditionally done manually, we have proposed to automate polishing on 5-axis machining centre using a passive elastomeric carrier. One of the main advantages of automatic polishing is the repeatability of the machine movements in order to achieve restricted form deviations. However, the material removal rate (MRR) during polishing depends on parameters such as contact pressure, relative velocity and tool wear. We have thus developed a model dedicated to our process to compute the effective MRR along the polishing tool path regarding the contact area and the contact pressure between the tool and the part.

Product flexibility is the ability of the manufacturing system to cope with the growing product variety to ensure better system performance. The aim of this paper is to point out the importance of product-resources interfaces in product flexibility assessment. Based on industrial experience, three product flexibility inductors are identified, which are gripping, setting and tooling interfaces, in order to build indicators as close as possible to real industry conditions. This research work investigates new factors to quantify product flexibility and provide manufacturing system designers with efficient decision-making support tools. In order to show the relevance of our approach, experimental results from the automotive industry are presented.                    \",\n",

Drivers such as mass customization strategies, high part-complexity needs, shorter prod- uct development cycles, a large pool of materials to choose from, abundant manufacturing processes, diverse streams of applications (e.g. aerospace, motor vehicles, and health care) and high cost incurred due to manufac- turability of the part have made it essential to choose the right compromise of materials, manufacturing processes and associated machines in early stages of design considering the Design for Additive Manufacturing guidelines. There exists a complex relationship between AM products and their process data. However, the literature to-date shows very less studies targeting this integration. As several criteria, material attributes and process function- ality requirements are involved for decision making in the industries, this paper introduces a generic decision methodology, based on multi-criteria decision-making tools, that will not only provide a set of compromised AM materials, processes and machines but will also act as a guideline for designers to achieve a strong foothold in the AM industry by providing practical solutions containing design oriented and feasible material-machine com- binations from a current database of 38 renowned AM vendors in the world.

However, more focus will be kept on the conceptual and embodiment design phases. Moreover, axioms are defined to aid in decision making and help in extracting the rules associated with each of the design criteria.

To help improving geometrical quality for AM, this study aims to propose geometrical deviation identification and prediction method for AM, which could be used for identifying the factors, forms and values of geometrical deviation of AM parts. Design/methodology/approach – This paper applied the skin model-based modal decomposition approach to describe the geometrical déviations of AM and decompose them into different defect modes. On that basis, the approach to propose and extend defect modes was developed. Identification and prediction of the geometrical deviations were then carried out with this method. Finally, a case study with cylinders manufactured by fused deposition modeling was introduced. Two coordinate measuring machine (CMM) machines with different measure methods were used to verify the effectiveness of the methods and modes proposed. Findings – The case study results with two different CMM machines are very close, which shows that the method and modes proposed by this paper are very effective. Also, the results indicate that the main geometrical defects are caused by the shrinkage and machine inaccuracy-induced errors which have not been studied enough.

The AM process allows new features (e.g., multi-material, fixed assemblies, complex shapes), and this paradigm shift requires the accompaniment of designers to take account of these characteristics. In response to this problematic, we propose a design methodology, in three stages, which respects the integrity of the digital channel and whose purpose is to provide a digital mock-up sliced ready to be manufactured on the most common AM process (Fused Deposition Modeling). From the specifications and the process knowledge, our methodology provides the designer a first solid geometry which satisfies all the constraints. Then, a topology optimization limits the useful volume of material of the part in order to limit the weight and the manufacturing time. If necessary, an optimized support providing manufacturability of the part is generated according to the same criteria.

Design/methodology/approach Different methods of support generation exist, but they are limited with regards to complex parts. This paper proposes a method dedicated to support generation, integrated into CAD software. The objective is to minimize the volume of support and its impact on a part\\'s surface finish. Two case studies illustrate the methodology. The support generation is based on an octree\\'s discretization of the part. Findings The method represents a first solid step in the support optimization for a reasonable calculation time. It has the advantage of being virtually automatic. The only tasks to be performed by the designer are to place the part to be studied with respect to the CAD reference and to give the ratio between the desired support volume and the maximum volume of support. Research limitations/implications In the case studies, a low gain in manufacturing time was observed. This is explained by the honeycomb structure of the support generated by a common slicing software whilst the proposed method uses a \"full\" structure. It would be interesting to study the feasibility of an optimized support, with a honeycomb structure but with a preservation of the surface which is in contact with the part. Originality/value This solution best fits the needs of the designer and manufacturer already taking advantage of existing solutions. It is adaptable to any part if the withdrawal of support is taken into account.

However, this emerging technology is disrupting the way design is carried out and creativity is often limited by the cognitive barriers installed through years of traditional manufacturing processes. Likewise, as this manufacturing process is relatively recent and quite unknown to designers, its specificities are not always considered during the design phase, which leads to manufactured parts happening to differ from CAD models in terms of sizing or surface quality. Consequently, microwave components nowadays manufactured layer-by-layer do not exhibit operational electromagnetic performances. In this way, it is necessary to guide designers throughout the development of a product by drawing their attention to the different steps they must consider in order to design an additive manufactured optimised part.

The main objective of the current work is to prevent designers from designing solutions that would be expensive and difficult to machine. Among all available solutions to achieve this goal, two are distinguished: the generative approach and the analogy approach. The generative approach is more adapted to generate the machining plans of parts composed of numerous boring operations in interaction.

In order to overcome these drawbacks, two new concepts of feature and three control algorithms are developed. The paper presents the two new features: the Machining Enabled Geometrical Feature (MEGF) and the Machinable Features (MbF). This development is the result of the separation of the geometrical and the technological data contained in one machining feature.

It aims to guide the designer in the analysis of product similarity, the identification of product subassemblies to optimise and the choice of consistent assembly solutions for an easier product family generation and optimised production. A case study from automotive industry is presented to illustrate the application of this approach.                    ',\n",

The methodology is based on the functional need analysis and the concept of work situations as defined by INRS in their previous research work. The aim is to bring together the “user” and the “designer” in a dynamic of dialogue, in order to define the main work situations and not only the technical system. An overview of the problem is first described, followed by a brief review of methods currently in use. We then describe the different steps involved in the proposed methodology, before examining the results of a case-study application to a milling machine in which the benefits of such an approach and its acceptability by SME/SMIs are assessed.

This latter has an important role in the design project whose exploitation mainly depends on how it has been established [1]. Furthermore, the growing competitive context hardly encourages firms to implement new working methods like collaborative engineering. However, its implementation in combination with product geometric data generates many problems in terms of project and data management. For this purpose, this article proposes a methodological solution to the problem at hand. Moreover the problem gets complicated as the project progresses. As a result, the detailed design phase becomes critical particularly in the face of this problem. Therefore, the current article focuses on this phase of the product design process through an example.                    ',\n",

A new mixed-integer programming model is proposed to minimize the total sum of the nominal and expected failure costs. This model considers complete and partial disruption at hubs. In addition, we propose a new hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm based on genetic and imperialist competitive algorithms. We compare the performance of the proposed al- gorithm with a new lower bound method in terms of the CPU time and solution quality. Furthermore, we conclude that a considerable improvement in the reliability of the net- work can be achieved with only a slight increase in the total cost.

Reconfigurable process planning is a new process planning approach which has been well recognized as a key enabler for current manufacturing paradigms. However, in the literature, there is neither a comprehensive part variety representation model to support reconfigurable process planning nor a global solution framework to instruct the generation of the feasible process plans for a specific part variant. Therefore, this paper extends the concept of reconfigurable process planning to a concept of reconfigurable machining process planning which targets the process plan generation for a part family. A solution framework is developed for reconfigurable machining process planning. In this framework, a feature-based part variety model\\r\\nis proposed to represent a part family; A reconfigurable machining process plan is defined as a set of modular components which can be configured/reconfigured into the machining process plans for any part variant in the family; a novel configuration approach is proposed to generate the process plan components for a specific part variant while configuring this part variant from the family.

The application of CPSs in production environments gave rise to the term Cyber Physical Production Systems (CPPSs). The emergence of CPPSs transforms the automation pyramid into a decentralized structure. Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) are being highly influenced by this transformation. Currently, there remains a dispute on the role of MES in CPPSs, specifically with respect to the functions they support in CPPSs. This paper aims to shed light on the role of MES in CPPSs by analyzing the functional models of the two. Firstly, functional models of CPPSs and MES are proposed in the form of IDEF0 diagrams. Then, data flows between the functional models of CPPSs and MES are described and the functions of the two are compared. We find that MES will continue to play a significant role in CPPSs, but it will take new forms. The next-generation of MES requires greater flexibility, dynamism and improved functionality.                    ',\n",

Due to this development, the need of agile and reconfigurable production systems emerged to cope with various products and product families. To design and optimize production systems as well as to choose the optimal product matches, product analysis methods are needed. Indeed, most of the known methods aim to analyze a product or one product family on the physical level. Different product families, however, may differ largely in terms of the number and nature of components. This fact impedes an efficient comparison and choice of appropriate product family combinations for the production system. A new methodology is proposed to analyze existing products in view of their functional and physical architecture. The aim is to cluster these products in new assembly oriented product families for the optimization of existing assembly lines and the creation of future reconfigurable assembly systems. Based on Datum Flow Chain, the physical structure of the products is analyzed. Functional subassemblies are identified, and a functional analysis is performed. Moreover, a hybrid functional and physical architecture graph (HyFPAG) is the output which depicts the similarity between product families by providing design support to both, production system planners and product designers. An illustrative example of a nail-clipper is used to explain the proposed methodology. An industrial case study on two product families of steering columns of thyssenkrupp Presta France is then carried out to give a first industrial evaluation of the proposed approach.

Material and manufacturing process selection are considered an important ingredient of RS and must be dealt with in early stages of design. Since, emerging technologies such as Additive Manufacturing (AM) have re-defined the potentials of manufacturing by re-orienting market drivers such as high part-complexity needs, individualization, shorter product development cycles, abundant materials and manufacturing processes, diverse streams of applications, etc., it is imperative to select the right compromise of materials, manufacturing processes and associated machines in early stages of design considering the Design for Additive Manufacturing guidelines. As several criteria, material attributes and process functionality requirements are involved for decision making in the industries today, an integrated design-oriented framework is proposed in this paper for RS in AM to structure design knowledge pertaining to each stage of design process; conceptual, embodiment and detail designs. However, more focus will be kept on the conceptual and embodiment design phases. Moreover, axioms are defined to aid in decision making and help in extracting the rules associated with each of the design criteria. The framework is aimed to act as a guideline for designers in the AM industry to provide design oriented and feasible material-machine-process combinations.                    ',\n",

However, outside machines that have specific safety standards, the designers of special machines and manufacturing systems can only use generic safety standards, limiting as a consequence the results of hazards detection. The aim of this paper is to present an original approach for this detection during the design of working equipment. We based our study on a hypothesis of the literature that links hazards to the presence of energy flows. Thus, the hazards detection is reduced to the study of the building of energy flows and the detection of potential links between these flows and the operator. Thanks to such data, the designer will be able to select the best risk prevention solutions. To reach this goal, we decided to use the Functional Energetic Model (FEMo) to model the technical system and its energy flows. This choice was made because this model was developed for the design of technical systems integrating different types of energy. By using this modelling, the designer can easily analyses every potential interactions between the energy flows and the operator, depending on the future working situations in each life cycle phases. Our approach builds on this model all along the design process, allowing the designer to early detect hazards and to apply at the best moment the risk prevention solutions. We present the application of this approach during the design of a working equipment, since the definition of the raw need. We confirm that its application and the system modelling in the EFM formalism are possible since the conceptual design phase. Data from the next design phases enrich the model, and consequently improve the detection and characterization of hazards.                    ',\n",

European directive 2006/42/CE promulgates machine safety design principles to prevent occupational risks. Aimed at machine designers, its objective is to set out the need to obtain the lowest possible risk level according to the state of the art. Although the designers of catalog machines have access to specific standards to perform a priori risk analyses, this is not the case for special machine designers. An original approach called EZID is presented in this paper to help all machine designers in the task of hazard identification. Based on the fact that hazards are linked to the presence of energies, EZID identifies hazards through the detection of design parameters linked to energy sources and flows. It then feeds back organized information to designers on every potential exchange of energy between the machine and its operators, bringing to light the need to add risk prevention solutions.\\nThe first part provides a detailed classification of energy parameters considered to be the primary indicators of hazards. This is followed by an explanation of the logical rules describing how damage is generated by the combination of the other design parameters, increasing the level of detail in hazard identification. The next part focuses on the characterization of significant hazards. Finally, the results obtained from using this approach during the industrial design of a supply line are presented to confirm that EZID is functional from the earliest stage of design.

Risks involved in a process and the corresponding risk factors are identified through a novel objective-oriented risk identification approach and analyzed qualitatively in the Process FMEA. Critical risks with high RPN (risk priority number) values identified in the FMEA are incorporated in the process model for further quantitative analysis in the simulation environment. To this end, risk measures of the critical risks are determined for which data is collected during simulation execution. Using the proposed methodology as a decision-making tool, alternative scenarios are developed and compared with each other as well as with two fictive situations to elicit normalized values for the risk measures employing value function approach. To ease the decision-making process in case of multiple risk measures, a global risk indicator is developed by aggregating the individual normalized risk measures through a 2-additive Choquet Integral operator. The global risk indicator is then used to rank the alternative scenarios on the basis of desirability. The methodology is illustrated with a case study issued from parts manufacturing but is applicable to a wide range of other processes.                    ',\n",

Due to the stochastic nature of production processes and since their production processes are sensitive to manufacturing variations; a proportion of products do not conform the design specifications. A common source of these variations is misadjustment of each operation that leads to a higher number of scraps. Therefore, uncertainty in misadjustment is taken into account in this study. A twofold decision is made on the subject that which quality characteristic needs what kind of inspection, and the time this inspection should be performed. To cope with the introduced uncertainty, two robust optimisation methods are developed based on Taguchi and Monte Carlo methods. Furthermore, a genetic algorithm is applied to the problem to obtain near-optimal solutions. To validate the proposed model and solution approach, several numerical experiments are done on a real industrial case. Finally, the conclusion is provided.                    ',\n",

The model involves two inter-related decisions: 1) which quality characteristics need what kind of inspections (i.e., which-what decision) and 2) when the inspection of these characteristics should be performed (i.e., when decision). These decisions require a trade-off between the cost of manufacturing (i.e., production, inspection and scrap costs) and the customer satisfaction. Due to inevitable variations in the manufacturing systems, a global robust BOMILP (RBOMILP) is developed to tackle the inherent uncertainty of the concerned parameters (i.e., production and inspection times, errors type I and II, misadjustment and dispersion of the process). In order to optimally solve the presented RBOMILP model, a meta-heuristic algorithm, namely differential evolution (DE) algorithm, is combined with the Taguchi and Monte Carlo methods. The proposed model and solution algorithm are validated through a real industrial case from a leading automotive industry in France.                    ',\n",

This review found that although numerous works have been already done on the PQIP, the development of multi-objective optimisation frameworks considering real production constraints under parameters uncertainty is necessary.

The proposed framework is applied to the modelling and evaluation of the a priori performance evaluation of manufacturing processes and to deciding on their alternatives.

In addition, a methodological framework is developed to provide\\r\\nguidelines for the decision-makers or performance evaluators of the processes. To facilitate the performance measurement and management process, this latter framework is organized in four phases: context establishment, performance\\r\\nmodelling, performance assessment, and decision-making. Each phase of the framework is then instrumented with state of-the-art quantitative analysis tools and methods. For process design and evaluation, the deliverable of the value- and\\r\\nrisk-based performance measurement and management system (VR-PMS) is a set of ranked solutions (i.e. alternative business processes) evaluated against the developed value and risk indicators.

A discrete event simulator is used to perform the simulation of these scenarios and to evaluate the value as a global performance criterion (balancing cost, quality, delivery time, services, etc.). An Analytical Hierarchy Process module supports the analysis process. The value chain model is based on activities and uses the concepts of resource consumption, while integrating the benefiting entities view point. A case study in the microelectronic field is carried out to corroborate the validity of the proposed VCS.                    ',\n",
       " \"\\nAbstract : In future work systems, the health and safety of production operators heavily depend on how the system is designed. For a better prevention, these systems must grant sufficient operators’ margin of manoeuvre, to cope with the foreseeable variability in a work situation, both normal and abnormal. This article presents four approaches that can be followed for better margin's integration during the different stages of production system's design process: by using functional analysis or failure mode analysis to predict unusual production means uses, flow simulation or digital human models to consider variability due to human factors, the designer can better comprehend the variability in the future systems and thus define adequate temporal margins which optimize performance and workers’ wellbeing.                                    \",\n",
       " '\\nAbstract : The work of product designers has to evolve in phase with the improvements made to technology and changes in regulations. They have to work on different aspects of a product such as its technological, legal, environmental and occupational safety implications.\\r\\nEuropean directive 2006/42/CE promulgates safe machine design principles to prevent professional risks. These principles guide machine designers to reduce residual risks as much as the technological state of the art permits. Special machine designers are by\\r\\ndefinition confronted by a lack of specific standards relating to a priori risk analysis. The aim of this paper is to present an original approach to help them to identify hazards upstream and also throughout the design process. This approach is based on the fact that hazards are linked to the presence of energies. Hazard identification can be done through the detection of parameters linked to energy sources and flows. The approach then feeds back information to designers about potential contacts between energies and workers, to highlight the need to add preventive measures. We use the Functional-Structural Model is used to represent the machine energy architecture through the different steps of its lifecycle. Thus it is possible to identify every interface through which energies circulate. These interfaces are defined by two kinds of parameter: energetic parameters (linked to energy properties), and other design parameters. This paper first presents a detailed classification of energetic parameters that are also indicators of the hazards present in the machine. We then present logical rules for processing these energetic parameters and others, in order to increase the accuracy of the hazard identification performed. To conclude, the results obtained from using this approach during the industrial design of a supply line is detailed to validate the pertinence of its application from the earliest design stages, with improved accuracy during the subsequent design stages.

Ceci permet d’éviter la formation de certains défauts apparaissant lors de la solidification en soudage par fusion comme les fissures à chaud ou les soufflures. Dans le cas des alliages d’aluminium, ceci offre de grandes possibilités comme le soudage des alliages des séries 2000 (Al-Cu) et 7000 (Al-Zn) ainsi que les alliages de fonderie. En FSW, l’énergie de soudage est produite par le travail de l’interaction mécanique entre un outil et les pièces à assembler. La matière localement malaxée doit rester confinée autour de l’outil. Ces deux derniers points vont contraindre la conception des pièces à assembler et la gamme de soudage. Cet article présente les premiers résultats d’une étude du potentiel du FSW pour la réalisation de pièce de forme complexe, traditionnellement obtenue en fonderie. Ce travail n’aborde pas la reconception de produit mais\\r\\ntraite des gammes de fabrication et de soudage en mettant en évidence les avantages et contraintes du procédé.

Les résultats présentés concernent le passage d’une soudure rectiligne à une soudure avec courbure, l’évolution au cours de soudage de l’orientation de l’outil, une variation de l’effort de forge et de la vitesse de soudage, l’apparition d’un défaut d’accostage. L’étude de l’influence de la nature de l’enclume et de la structure métallurgique initiale de l’alliage fait également l’objet de ce document. Les principaux résultats montrent que la réponse du procédé à une variation de conditions opératoires se fait en deux temps. Le premier temps correspond à la réponse instantanée de l’outil aux nouvelles conditions opératoires dans une matière dont l’état est issu des conditions antérieures. Le deuxième temps correspond à l’évolution plus lente du procédé vers un nouveau régime permanent associé aux nouvelles conditions. La thermique du procédé semble avoir un effet prépondérant sur la valeur et l’évolution des efforts de soudage.                    ',\n",

However, more\\r\\ninvestigation on a curved friction stir weld trajectory is still required to industrialize this promising process. In the same perspective, this study is aimed at analyzing the influence of nonlinear tool trajectory in friction stir welding. The study considers a variety of circular trajectories on the plane plate and uses them for experimentation while considering different welding parameters of rotation speed feed speed, axial force and tilt angle.\\r\\nIn FSW, the tool is generally needed to be tilted with a constant angle in the travel direction during welding process. Therefore, for circular trajectory, an adequate roll and pitch angle are assigned to the spindle in all tool positions. The paper presents the effect of circular trajectory on longitudinal and transversal forces generated during circular welding. The results are then compared with the experimental results which are obtained using linear FSW. Furthermore, the experimental investigation includes relationship between tool trajectory and weld quality.                    ',\n",

Ses principaux avantages proviennent du fait qu'il permet de réaliser des soudures à l'état solide de proche en proche. Ceci lui permet d'assembler des pièces de géométrie complexes dans des alliages difficiles à souder par fusion. Toutefois le principe physique et technologique du procédé est très différent de celui des procédés de soudage par fusion. Notamment, la soudure est obtenue par l'action mécanique d'un outil en interaction avec la matière à souder. Pour évaluer la pertinence et le gain potentiel d'une soudure FSW par rapport à une soudure conventionnelle à l'arc une étape de reconception détaillée des pièces en intégrant les potentialités et lescontraintes du FSW est nécessaire. Dans cet article est présentée une première contribution à la mise en place d'un processus de reconception de produit en intégrant le potentiel du FSW. Ce travail, à partir d'une étude de cas s'appuie sur l'identification des contraintes et des potentiels du FSW et leur intégration dans le processus de fabrication de la pièce et l'évaluation des performances et du coût de la pièce.                    \",\n",

Le potentiel du FSW vient en grande partie du fait que la matière n'atteint pas la fusion lors de l'élaboration de la soudure. Ceci permet notamment de souder des alliages sensibles à la fissuration à chaud et de réaliser des assemblages hétérogènes. La reconception du produit doit tenir compte des contraintes du FSW. Ces dernières ont été identifiées et correspondent à la nécessité de contenir la matière lors du malaxage. Ceci se traduit par une contrainte d'accessibilité de l'outil à la soudure, de celle d'une enclume à l'envers de la soudure et à la présence de matière en épaisseur suffisante autour du pion. Une autre contrainte vient des efforts générés lors du soudage. Les géométries conçues doivent permettre la réalisation d'un montage de soudage supportant les efforts de soudage. L'étude particulière de l'une des soudures du démonstrateur a permis de mettre en évidence la relative tolérance du FSW au défaut de mise en position des pièces à souder et de suivi de trajectoire.                    \",\n",

Dans sa configuration conventionnelle, l’outil FSW n’est pas considéré comme un consommable lors du soudage des alliages d’aluminium. Sa partie active constituée d’un épaulement et d’un pion permet l’échauffement et le malaxage de la matière. Dans cette étude, on s’intéresse tout d’abord à analyser l’influence de la géométrie de l’outil sur la qualité du cordon. En effet, pour plusieurs géométries d’outil de soudage, les domaines de soudabilités opératoires sont définis et comparés. À partir de ces résultats, la robustesse des différentes géométries d’outil vis-à-vis de la qualité du malaxage lors d’une variation des paramètres de soudage est évaluée. D’autre part, pendant le soudage l’interaction outil/matière évolue suivant la géométrie des surfaces actives de l’outil FSW. Aussi, l’outil FSW a une influence sur les efforts engendrés au cours du soudage. Ces derniers sont donc également analysés afin de définir l’influence de la géométrie sur leurs variations. Dans un objectif de robotisation du procédé, cette étude est une première étape dans l’optimisation de l’outil en trouvant le bon compromis entre qualité du joint soudé et amplitude des efforts.

In this work 15 kg walls are built with an effective building rate of 4.85 kg/h using an ER100 wire providing good tensile properties and toughness under welding conditions. The thermal evolution of the walls during manufacturing is measured by thermocouples and an IR camera: it depends on process parameters, deposit strategy and the size of the part. The walls are then characterised as deposit and after heat treatment through hardness, tensile and Charpy-V notch tests. The results show a fine microstructure with unexpected retained austenite and coarse allotriomorphic ferrite in the as deposited walls. The final hardness values vary from about 220 to 280 HV2; the yield stress and tensile strength are 520 and 790 MPa, respectively, and a toughness of about 50 J is obtained at room temperature. The heat treatment transforms the retained austenite, leading to an improvement of the yield\\r\\nstress to 600 MPa.                    ',\n",

identified from measured signals at low velocities and with the use of a closed loop identification method the measured signals are very noised the number of measurement samples available is very low the friction model dépends on position velocity and acceleration and includes the coulomb stribeck and viscous frictions a hystérésis effect integrated by an expntial term and the acceleration is added in the model the identified parameters are validated by applying an efficient precision method based on the sensitivity analysis of nonlinear models and a normalized mean square error criterion     abstract this  presents the static equilibrium workspace of an under constrained cable driven robot with four cables taking into account the forces and the moments due to the forces acting on the moving platform the problem is formulated as a non linear optimization problem with maintaining static equilibrium as the objective function the simulations are d  matlab the maximum force on the cables and tilting angle of the platform are  to define the feasible static equilibrium workspace and the results obtained are  to finalize the design of the collaborative cable driven robot to be installed in existing production lines for the agile handling of parts in a manufacturing industry    this report presents the dynamic modeling of a planar biped robot the robot has seven bodies and 9 dof  kinematic configurations are investigated the first has only revolute joints on all articulation the second differs by the presence of rolling contact on the knees all matrices involved in the model are given in explicit form all the possibilities of contact between the feet and the ground are considered    abstract recently underactuated bipeds with pointed feet have been studied to achieve dynamic and energy efficient robot walking patterns however these studies usually simplify a robot torso as  link which is different from a human torsos containing 33 vertebrae in this  therefore we study the optimal walking of a 6 link planar biped with a segmented torso derived from its 5 link counterpart while ensuring that  models are equivalent when the additional torso joint is locked for the walking we suppose that each step is composed of a single support phase and an instantaneous double support phase and  phases are connected by a plastic impact mapping in addition the controlled outputs named symmetry outputs capable of generating expntially stable orbits  hybrid zero dynamics are adopted to improve physical interpretation the desired outputs are parameterized by b ezier functions with 5 link robot having 16 parameters to optimizeand 6 link robot having 19 parameters according to our energy criterion the segmented torso structure may reduce energy consumption up to 8 in bipedal walking and the maximum energy saving is achieved at high walking speeds while leaving the criteria at low walking speeds remain similar for both robots   abstract this  proposes a non linear observer to estimate not only the state position and velocity of links but also the external forces exerted by the robot during friction stir welding fsw processes the difficulty of performing this process with a robot lies in its lack of rigidity in order to ensure a better tracking performance the data such as real positions velocities of links and external forces are required however those variations are not always measured in most industrial robots therefore in this study an observer is  to reconstruct those necessary parameters by  only measurements of motor side the  observer is carried out on a 6 dof flexible joint industrial manipulator  in a fsw process    in this  we address the problem of optimization of trajectories for a new class of biped robot the knees of this biped are similar as the anthropomorphic  and have a rolling contact between the femur and the tibia the robot has seven mechanical links and six actuators the walking gait considered is a succession of single support phase ssp and impact of the mobile foot with the ground cubic uniform spline functions defined on a time interval express the gait for  step an energy consumption function and a torques quadratic function are  to compare the new robot with anthropomorphic knees to a conventional robot with revolute joint knees the minimization of the criteria is made with simplex algorithm the physical constraints concerning the zmp and the mobile foot behavior are respectively checked to make a step simulation results show that the energy consumption of the new biped with rolling knee contact is less than that of the robot with revolute joint knees    the knee of biped robots has usually  degree of freedom which  is a revolute joint this work focuses on the study of rolling contact knee the knee is composed of a cylinder in the extremity of the femur rolling on another cylindrical surface which is the tibia studies have shown that this structure allows to reduce the torque during the gait energetic optimization series were made with this structure and for different cylinder radii the angular trajectories describing the gait are generated by cubic splines functions the gait is composed of single support phase followed by an impact the minimization of energetic criterion is realized  the simplex algorithm of nelder mead the results show that higher radii of the tibia permit to reduce energy consumption during the gait the study of new contact surfaces is a way to decrease the energy consumption    this  presents the influence of payload and platform dimensions on the static equilibrium workspace of an under constrained cable driven robot with four cables taking into account the forces and the moments due to the forces acting on the moving platform the problem is formulated as a non linear optimization problem with maintaining static equilibrium as the objective function the simulations are d in matlab the maximum force on the cables the payload acting on the platform and the dimensions of the moving platform are varied and their corresponding effects on the static equilibrium is studied the obtained results are analyzed to finalize the design of the collaborative cable driven robot to be installed in existing production lines for the agile handling of parts in a manufacturing industry    this  presents the energy consumption of a biped robot with a new modelled structure of knees which is called rolling knee rk the dynamic model the actuators and the friction coefficients of the gear box are known the optimal energy consumption can also be calculated the first part of the  is to validate the new kinematic knee on a biped robot by comparing the energy consumption during a walking step of the identical biped but with revolute joint knees the cyclic gait is given by a succession of single support phase ssp followed by an impact the gait trajectories are parameterized by cubic spline functions the energetic criterion is minimized through optimization while  the simplex algorithm and lagrange penalty functions to meet the constraints of stability and deflection of the mobile foot an analysis of the friction coefficients is d by simulation to compare the human characteristics to the robot with rk the simulation results show an energy consumption reduction through the biped with rolling knee configuration the influence of friction coefficients shows the energy consumption of biped robot is close to that of the human     friction stir welding is known for his capability to achieve a linear weld however more investigation on a curved friction stir weld trajectory is still required to industrialize this promising process in the same perspective this study is aimed at analyzing the influence of nonlinear tool trajectory in friction stir welding the study considers a variety of circular trajectories on the plane plate and uses them for experimentation while considering different welding parameters of rotation speed feed speed axial force and tilt angle in fsw the tool is generally needed to be tilted with a constant angle in the travel direction during welding process therefore for circular trajectory an adequate roll and pitch angle are assigned to the spindle in all tool positions the  presents the effect of circular trajectory on longitudinal and transversal forces generated during circular welding the results are then compared with the experimental results which are obtained  linear fsw furthermore the experimental investigation includes relationship between tool trajectory and weld quality    robotic manipulators are widely  in industry for welding processes inadequate joint stiffness in the manipulators often limits their use for high quality welding operations because of the deformation errors produced during the process as a matter of fact welding quality deteriorates with decreasing joint stiffness this  presents an approach to determine an optimal workspace of operation by minimizing the lateral deflection errors in position and orientation of the end effector during friction stir welding this has been d by estimating the errors in position and orientation of the end effector also the point of contact with work piece which directly affects welding quality when it experiences a wrench during welding operation the technique was applied to an elastodynamic model of a 6 dof manipulator with different path constraints for welding process to achieve optimal task placement in a nutshell optimal starting position or an optimal direction of motion for best welding quality can be precisely computed or even both together can be calculated but with numerical complexity     this  deals with the study of high speed switched reluctance motors and their pre dimensioning the predimensioning is tackled towards the inductance profile and the torque generation then the power density is assessed in terms of three defined fundamental parameters each depending on electrical mechanical and geometrical design of the motor the mechanical limitations studied are the centrifugal stresses and the vibratory behavior of the motor a shape optimization of the rotor teeth leans then on a coupled magnetic mechanic coupled problem solved with finite elements simulations after that mechanic magnetic and copper losses are given in terms of the rotor external volume so as to assess the weight of each heat source in the global motor heating once all the losses are linked to temperature a criterion to improve the ability to develop a high speed motor is finally     the design of humanoid robots has been a tricky challenge for several years due to the kinematic complexity of human joints their movements are notoriously difficult to be reproduced by a mechanism the human knees allow movements including rolling and sliding and therefore the design of new bioinspired knees is of utmost importance for the reproduction of anthropomorphic walking in the sagittal plane in this article the kinematic characteristics of knees were analyzed and a mechanical solution for reproducing them is  the geometrical kinematic and dynamic models are built together with an impact model for a biped robot with the new knee kinematic the walking gait is studied as a problem of parametric optimization under constraints the trajectories of walking are approximated by mathematical functions for a gait composed of single support phases with impacts energy criteria allow comparing the robot provided with the new rolling knee mechanism and a robot equipped with revolute knee joints the results of the optimizations show that the rolling knee brings a decrease of the sthenic criterion the comparisons of torques are also observed to show the difference of energy distribution between the actuators for the same actuator selection these results prove that the robot with rolling knees can walk longer than the robot with revolute joint knees    the objective of this report is to detail the models  in simulation and the results obtained in simulation for both machining and fsw process this report contains in a first part the details of modeling flexibilities of serial robots primarily through a model of localized flexibilities the flexibilities are expressed both in cartesian space and in the joint space and taking into account possible couplings the second part deals with the dynamic model  in the simulator and the simulation environment a significant work was to also model the company kuka robot controller machining processes and fsw are modeled by simple models but reflecting the reality of the behavior   abstract this  proposes to use a non linear observer to build the state and the external force of flexible manipulator robots during their machining composite materials processes or friction stir welding fsw processes these  different processes have a problem in common the flexibility of the robot can not be neglected that is to say the errors due to the deformation of the links should be taken into account however in most industrial robots the real positions and velocities of each link are not measured so in this study an observer is  to reconstruct the real angular positions and velocities of links by  the measured angular positions and the velocities of actuators a simulation by matlab simulink has been carried out with a 2 axis robot during its machining processes the  observer showed great performances in estimating the state of the robot position and velocity then in order to improve the tracking accuracy in the tool frame the state of the external force along the forward direction x and its normal direction y are required while they are also not measured by our robot a disturbance observer has been added to reconstruct the processing force a good precision during the  processes have been obtained  the latter this study contributes to solve the problem from the point of view of accuracies during the machining processes    this  presents the main idea of the design and control of the robot rabbit    this  proposes  new methods for the identification of static stiffnesses of multi degrees of freedom heavy industrial robots they are based on a locked link joint procedure obtained with an end effector fixed to the environment the first method requires only measurements of motor positions and motor torques data computed from motor current measurements and manufacturer s drive gains the second  needs a torque sensor to measure the interaction wrench between the clamped end effector and the environment these methods are being experimentally validated and compared on the 2 first joints of a 6 degrees of freedom heavy 500kg payload industrial kuka kr500 robot     human

first presented then some local and global performances indices are to machining operations of metallic and composite parts and friction stir welding are presented a new method for the stiffness modeling of serial and parallel manipulators is also introduced as a matter of fact some performance indices depend on the stiffness of the manipulator under study finally the  technique is illustrated by means of the comparison of three degrees of freedom translational manipulators   abstract this  deals with the modelling of a piezo electric stack actuator  to generate specific low

experimental results     the  focuses on the robust identification of geometrical and elastostatic parameters of robotic manipulator the main attention is paid to the efficiency improvement of the identification algorithm to increase the identification accuracy it is  to apply the weighted least square technique that employs a new algorithm for assigning of the weighting coefficients the latter allows taking into account variation of the measurement system precision in different directions and throughout the robot workspace the advantages of the  approach are illustrated by an application example that deals with the elasto static calibration of industrial robot    application of vibration in metal forming process has already shown numerous advantages in the past it improves not only mechanical and surface properties of workpiece but the integration of vibration in metal forming process has also been helpful in the reduction of forming force required for the process majority of the work d before in this field is related to single vibration source vibration and its application in metal forming process the aim of this work is to develop a mathematical model for multi vibration assisted forging process the combination of multi mechanical vibrations generates a complicated movement of lower die without deforming it this developed mathematical model proves that movement is basically in the form of progressive wave in the lower die thus resulting local surface movement in reality this movement can be generated by the vibration given by multi piezoelectric actuators based on this mathematical model simulations  finite element software forge2011 have been performed to observe the presence of progressive wave in the workpiece the simulations kinematics confirms the existence of progressive wave in the workpiece simulation results demonstrate the effect of progressive wave to reduce the forging force reduction of friction on the lower surface of die and hence improvement the forging process based on the developed mathematical model and simulation results design proposition for multi vibration assisted forging process has been presented in this work    in this study an experimental setup of a forging process has been designed which allows to apply vibrations to the lower die of amplitude ranging from 0 to 80µm at frequencies varying from 1 to 130hz thanks to the use of a stack piezoelectric actuator fed by an electronic inverter in order to explore those results a coupling model has been developed to provide a design tool in a mechatronic frame which consists of an analytical model of the forging process based on simplified visco plastic laws and a state space model of the piezoelectric actuator based on a finite element approach 1 the coupling model can be  to analyse the important parameters of the whole process in order to optimize the forging process design  mechanical vibrations or to control the process if necessary a finite element simulation of forging process  mechanical vibration based on finite element software forge2008 is also presented in this study the results obtained by experiment finite element simulation and simulation  the model above are compared in the case of simple upsetting with good agreement moreover it can be concluded that high frequencies are not required to observe this phenomenon finally visco plasticity phenomenon is not self sufficient to explain completely the force reduction    use of vibration in the forming process has already shown numerous advantages in the improvement of mechanical and surface properties of workpiece such as good surface or less friction between die and workpiece the aim of this work is to develop a mathematical model of a progressive wave in the lower die due to the vibration given by multi piezoelectric actuators to assist the forging process based on the mathematical model simulations  nite element software forge2011 have been performed to observe the presence of progressive wave in the workpiece due to the movement of the lower die the simulations results con rm the existence of progressive wave in the workpiece and demonstrate the e ect of progressive wave to reduce the forging load and improve the forging process    vibration assisted forming is  of the most recent and beneficial technique used to improve forming process effects of vibration on metal forming processes can be attributed to  causes first the volume effect links lowering of yield stress with the influence of vibration on the dislocation movement second the surface effect explains lowering of the effective coefficient of friction by periodic reduction contact area this work is related to vibration assisted forming process in viscoplastic domain impact of change in vibration waveform has been analyzed for this purpose  analytical models have been developed for  different types of vibration waveforms sinusoidal and triangular these models were developed on the basis of slice method that is used to find out the required forming force for the process final relationships show that application of triangular waveform in forming process is more beneficial as compare to sinusoidal vibrations in terms of reduced forming force finite element method fem based simulations were performed  forge2008 and these confirmed the results of analytical models the ratio of vibration speed to upper die speed is a critical factor in the reduction of the forming force    the purpose is to define the range of feasible speeds for  walking motions for a particular planar biped robot which differ in the definition of their finite time double support phases for each speed these  walking motions are numerically obtained by  a parametric optimization algorithm regarding a sthenic criterion results allow us to define the range of allowable speeds for each walking  result is that the first gait is less consuming in energy for moderate to fast velocity with respect to the second  while the second gait is more efficient for low walking velocity    review article of the exhibition and catalogue jean antoine watteau 1684 1721 washington national gallery of

are extensively  in living organisms as genetic markers and in oncology to detect microsatellite instability msi while the standard analysis method of microsatellites is based on pcr followed by capillary electrophoresis it generates undesirable frameshift products known as stutter peaks ca by the polymerase slippage that can greatly complicate the analysis and interpretation of the data here we present an easy multiplexable approach replacing pcr that is based on low temperature isothermal amplification  recombinase polymerase amplification lt rpa that drastically reduces and sometimes completely abolishes the formation of stutter artifacts thus greatly simplifying the calling of the alleles  ht17 a mononucleotide dna repeat that was previously  as an optimal marker to detect msi in

we showcase this nonlinear patch method in a simulation of a space plasma around a negatively charged array of solar generator interconnect    we consider the linear stochastic wave equation with spatially homogenous gaussian noise which is fractional in time with index we show that the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the solution is a relaxation of the condition obtained in cite dalang99 when the noise is white in time under this condition we show that the solution is continuous similar results are obtained for the heat equation unlike the white noise case the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the solution in the case of the heat equation is em different and more general than the  obtained for the wave equation    forging in semi

where the benefits of thixoforging are reached at a significant extent within the classical process framework of hot forging the  investigates this proposal up to a full scale proof of concept in an industrial setting    this  is devoted to the time integration of elasto plastic constitutive models in view of their implementation in finite element software for the simulation of metal forming processes both implicit and explicit time integration schemes are reviewed and presented in algorithmic form the incremental kinematics are also treated so that the  algorithms can be used stand al outside a finite element code or they can serve to implement non classical incremental kinematics full algorithms are provided along with examples of application to non monotonic loading for a mild steel and a dual phase steel    we consider the stochastic heat equation with multiplicative noise in where denotes the wick product and the solution is interpreted in the mild sense the noise is fractional in time with hurst index and colored in space with spatial covariance kernel we prove that if is the riesz kernel of order or the bessel kernel of order respectively if whereas if is the heat kernel or the poisson kernel then the equation has a solution for any we give a representation of the th order moment of the solution in terms of an expntial moment of the convoluted weighted

criterion in the aim to describe accurately the mechanical behavior of sheet metals large strain fully three dimensional implicit time integration algorithms are developed for this model and implemented in the finite element code abaqus the resulting code is  to predict the strain localization limits as well as the springback after forming of sheet steels the impact of strain path dependent hardening models on the limit strains and on the amount of springback is addressed    the strain localization phenomenon that may occur during sheet metal forming represents a major cause of defective parts produced in the industry several instability criteria have been developed in the literature to predict the occurrence of these instabilities the  work aims to couple a gurson type model to the rice s localization criterion the implementation of the modeling is achieved via a user subroutine umat in abaqus std  a runge kutta explicit integration scheme finally we show the effectiveness of the  coupling for the prediction of the formability of stretched metal sheets    the aim of this  is to give an overview of the theoretical basis of the most significant and commonly  localization criteria reformulated into a unified framework and to apply these criteria to different materials in order to determine their formability domains after giving a general material description based on a phenomenological approach theoretical foundations of localization criteria are presented together with their advantages and drawbacks these criteria rely on diverse theories maximum load principle bifurcation analysis marciniak kuczynski analysis and stability analysis by a linear perturbation method they are then applied to a brass and a dual phase steel and the predicted forming limit diagrams fld are discussed     large strain hardening is the main material description ingredient for cold bulk forming process simulations hardening identification of large strains is a trade off between cost standardization and the ability to represent the experiment but there are no standard procedures to date in this  approach large strains larger than 1 are reached  an industrial wire drawing process and measured data for identification are obtained from standard tensile tests fast semi analytical post processing was possible despite the significant process inherited strain heterogeneity the parameters of state of the art hardening models were identified and the robustness was demonstrated to reach far beyond the strain level attained in the experiments as a consequence accurate and robust large strain hardening modelling was achieved from standard tensile test acquisition by  industrial wire drawing pre strains    the aim of this work is to develop a dislocation density based model for if and dp steels that incorporates details of the microstructure evolution at the grain size scale the model takes into account i the contribution of the chemical composition for the prediction of the initial yield stress ii the description of initial texture anisotropy by incorporating grain size dependent anisotropy coefficients in hill 48 yield criterion iii the contribution of three dislocation density families that are associated with forward reverse and latent structures it reproduces the macroscopic transient behaviors observed when strain path changes occur the model is implemented in fe code in order to assess its predictive capabilities in case of industrial applications    the springback behavior of four advanced high strength sheet steels dual phase trip ferrite bainite with thicknesses ranging from 1 2 to 4 mm was investigated by means of the bending under tension but test the applicability of several guidelines from the literature was investigated experimentally and numerically the monotonic decrease of springback as back force increased was confirmed for this category of sheet steels and a general trend for the non linear influence of the tool radius was observed the influence of numerical factors on the predicted values of springback was investigated and conclusions and simple guidelines were drawn from the analysis with industrial sheet forming applications in mind    in this article we consider the stochastic heat equation in with vanishing initial conditions driven by a gaussian noise which is fractional in time with hurst index and colored in space with spatial covariance given by a function our main result gives the necessary and sufficient condition on for the existence of the process solution when is the riesz kernel of order this condition is which is a relaxation of the condition encountered when the noise is white in space when is the bessel kernel or the heat kernel the condition remains     in this work we propose to couple the gurson tvergaard needleman gtn model known for its widespread use to describe damage evolution in metallic materials to the rice localization criterion the implementation of the constitutive modeling is achieved via a user material umat subroutine in the commercial finiteelement code abaqus large deformations are taken into account within a three dimensional co rotational framework the effectiveness of the  coupling for the prediction of the formability of stretched metal sheets is shown and forming limit diagrams flds are plotted for an aluminum alloy a sensitivity analysis with respect to hardening parameters is carried out andit is shown that these effects are much smaller for the case of the rice criterion when compared toclassical criteria commonly utilized in metal forming    in this contribution the formulation of the shb8ps continuum shell finite element is extended to anisotropic elastic plastic behavior models with combined isotropic kinematic hardening at large deformations the resulting element is then implemented into the commercial implicit finite element code abaqus standard via the uel subroutine the shb8ps element is an eight node three dimensional brick with displacements as the only degrees of freedom and a preferential direction called the thickness a reduced integration scheme is adopted  an arbitrary number of integration points along the thickness direction and only  integration point in the other directions the hourglass modes due to this reduced integration are

description of the various throughthickness phenomena its performance is assessed through several applications involving different types of non linearities geometric material and that induced by contact particular attention is given to springback prediction for a numisheet benchmark problem    in this work the finite element method is  to simulate a typical fld test over tools of different radii parameters like the mesh density element type numerical determination of the onset of strain localization limit strain definition etc have been investigated finally the limit strain for plane strain tension has been determined as a function of the thickness vs tool radius t r ratio these simulations confirm that increasing the curvature of the tool increases the value of the limit strains they also reveal that as soon as bending becomes important the practical relevance of the limit strains diminishes at least with their current definition the need for new strain localization models is emphasized together with some of the associated challenges    in this contribution the formulation of the shb8ps continuum shell finite element is extended to anisotropic elastic plastic behavior

contact particular attention is given to springback prediction for a numisheet benchmark problem    automotive industries are more and more subject to restrictive environmental constraints weight reduction of structures seems to be an interesting way to satisfy these requirements this can be achieved either by  new materials such as high strength steels or by adopting appropriate dimensioning methods to predict the occurrence of strain localization forming limit diagram fld is a concept widely  to characterize the formability of thin metal sheets analytical determination of flds is usually based on the use of localization criteria some of the existing material instability criteria are for example based on empirical observations on the maximum load principle 1 3 on the existence of an initial defect in the sheet 4 on a perturbation method 5 or on bifurcation analysis 6 although numerous criteria have been developed they all have advantages but also drawbacks and limitations their confrontation on a wide range of materials is still insufficiently developed to compare their respective capability of accurately predicting flds for new materials adaptations of some criteria to advanced constitutive laws are also made necessary by the use of new high strength materials the aim of this  is to give a general formulation of some localization criteria allowing the comparison of the predicted flds for a wide range of materials an implementation of these criteria coupled with different phenomenological constitutive laws is presented and compared for different materials including an aluminium alloy a brass and a dual phase steel    this work aims to study the strain localization in different sheet metal forming processesby the finite element method  advanced behaviour models in order to improve the prediction of the formability limit of sheets under forming it is important to consider constitutive models that take into account the degradation of material properties due to large strain localization for this purpose an elastic plastic model has been coupled with the classical damage model of lemaitre and chaboche 2 3  hardening models are considered in an attempt to more accurately reproduce the work hardening phenomenon at large strains the first  represents the classical cyclic hardening model of chaboche marquis 3 4 while the second corresponds to the so called dislocation based microstructural model of teodosiu and hu 5 6 these  models are able to reproduce some transient hardening phenomena at strain path changes with a better description obtained with the microstructural model the coupling with damage is carried out within the framework of continuum damage mechanics thanks to the introduction of a scalar variable describing the degradation of the elastic proprieties and consequently softening behaviour when damage occurs the coupled elastic plastic damage model is implemented into the abaqus software  an implicit integration scheme the resulting code is used for the prediction of forming limit diagrams    sheet metal forming processes often involve complex loading sequences to improve the prediction of some undesirable phenomena such as springback physical behavior models should be considered this  investigates springback behavior predicted by advanced elastoplastic hardening models which combine isotropic and kinematic hardening and take strain path changes into account a dislocation based microstructural hardening model formulated from physical observations and the more classical cyclic model of chaboche have been considered in this work numerical implementation was carried out in the abaqus software  a return mapping algorithm with a combined backward euler and semi analytical integration scheme of the constitutive equations the capability of each model to reproduce transient hardening phenomena at abrupt strain path changes has been shown via simulations of sequential rheological tests a springback analysis of strip drawing tests was performed in order to emphasize the impact of several influential parameters namely process numerical and behavior parameters the effect of the  hardening models with respect to the process parameters has been specifically highlighted     within the framework of sheet metal forming the importance of hardening models for springback predictions has been often emphasized while some specific applications require very accurate models in many common situations simpler isotropic hardening models may be sufficient in these conditions investigation of the impact of hardening models requires well defined test configurations and accurate measurements to generate the reference data specific draw bend tests have been especially conceived for this purpose in this work such a draw bending experimental device has been designed for use on a biaxial tension machine three different steel sheets have been tested  mild steel sheet and  hss sheets with thicknesses between 0 8 and 2 mm up to three different back force levels were used for the tests wall curvatures and springback angles were measured finite element simulations of the tests were performed a parameter sensitivity analysis has been carried out in order to determine the numerical parameters ensuring accurate springback results the tests were simulated  an isotropic hardening model and a combined isotropic kinematic hardening model the impact of the hardening model is explored for the various test configurations and conclusions are drawn concerning their relative importance    this  proposes an extension of the shb8ps solid shell finite element to large strain anisotropic elasto plasticity with application to several non linear benchmark tests including sheet metal forming simulations this hexahedral linear element has an arbitrary number of integration points distributed along a single line defining the thickness direction and to control the hourglass modes inherent to this reduced integration a physical stabilization technique is  in addition the assumed strain method is adopted for the elimination of locking the implementation of the element in abaqus standard via the uel user subroutine has been assessed through a variety of benchmark problems involving geometric non linearities anisotropic plasticity large deformation and contact initially designed for the efficient simulation of elastic plastic thin structures the shb8ps exhibits interesting potentialities for sheet metal forming applications both in terms of efficiency and accuracy the element shows good performance on the selected tests including springback and earing predictions for numisheet benchmark problems    abstract modeling of ductile damage is generally d  analytical potentials which are expressed in the stress space in this  for the first time it is shown that strain rate potentials which are exact conjugate of the stress based potentials can be instead used to model the dilatational response of porous polycrystals a new integration algorithm is also developed it is to be noted that a strain rate based formulation is most appropriate when the plastic flow of the matrix is described by a criterion that involves dependence on all stress invariants in such cases although a strain rate potential is known the stress based potential cannot be obtained explicitly while the  framework based on strain rate potentials is general for comparison purposes in this work we present an illustration of the approach for the case of a porous solid with von mises matrix containing randomly distributed spherical cavities comparison between simulations  the strain rate based approach and the classical stress based gurson s criterion in uniaxial tension is presented these results show that the model based on a strain rate potential predicts the dilatational response with the same level of accuracy    modelling of plastic anisotropy requires the definition of stress potentials coinciding with the yield criteria in case of the associated flow rules or alternatively plastic strain rate potentials the latter approach has several advantages whenever material parameters are determined by means of texture measurements and crystal plasticity simulations this  deals with a phenomenological description of anisotropy in elastoplastic rate insensitive models by  strain rate potentials a fully implicit time integration algorithm is developed in this framework and implemented in a static implicit finite element code algorithmic details are discussed including the derivation of the consistent algorithmic tangent modulus and the numerical treatment of the yield condition typical sheet forming applications are simulated with the  implementation  the recent non quadratic strain rate potential srp2004 18p numerical simulations are carried out for materials that exhibit strong plastic anisotropy the numerical results confirm that the presented algorithm exhibits the same generality robustness accuracy and time efficiency as state of the art yield criterion based algorithms    the present contribution consists of implementing an advanced gtn damage model as a user material subroutine in the abaqus fe code this damage model is based on specific nucleation and growth laws this model is applied to the prediction of the damage evolution and the stress state in notched specimens made of dual phase steel by comparing numerical predictions with experimental results based on high resolution x ray absorption tomography the numerical approach was improved and validated    a physically based elasto visco plastic constitutive model is presented and compared to experimental results for a dd14 mild steel the model requires significantly fewer material parameters compared to other visco plasticity models from the literature while exhibiting very good accuracy accordingly the parameter identification is simple and intuitive requiring a relatively small set of experiments the strain rate sensitivity modeling is not restricted to a particular hardening law and thus provides a general framework in which advanced hardening equations can be adopted and compared the model has been implemented in the commercial finite element code abaqus explicit first predictions compared to experiments are analyzed and underline the effect of hardening law and strain rate sensitivity on 3d finite element simulations the model has been also applied as the basis for a homogenization approach at the phase scale preliminary investigations showed the benefits of coupling such an approach with scale transition technique where microstructure relevant data can explicitly enter the model and may be  for material design simulations    many criteria have been developed during last decades to predict diffuse or localized necking and shear banding the lack of confrontation of these models with each other on relevant applications makes their choice difficult for the designer it is  to reformulate these plastic instability criteria in an unified framework to compare their theoretical bases to establish links between them and then to highlighten their limitations in the case of diffuse necking a comparison is made between the criteria based on bifurcation analysis and on those based on maximum force principle for elastic plastic materials in the case of localized modes it is shown that the predictions of the marciniak kuczynski approach based on a multiz model tend to those of the loss of ellipticity criterion when the initial defect size tends to zero no initial defect introduced in the case of elasto viscoplastic behavior an approach based on a linear stability analysis is mentid    a physically based elasto visco plastic constitutive model is presented and compared to experimental results for three different mild steels the experiments consist of tensile tests ranging from quasi static conditions up to strain rates of 103 s 1 as well as quasi static simple and reverse shear tests at different amounts of pre strain additional  step sequential mechanical tests bauschinger and orthogonal effects have been performed to further evaluate the ability of the model to describe strain path changes at moderate large strains the model requires significantly fewer material parameters compared to other visco plasticity models from the literature while being able to describe some of the main features of the strain rate sensitivity of mild steels accordingly the parameter identification is simple and intuitive requiring a relatively small set of experiments the strain rate sensitivity modeling is not restricted to a particular hardening law and thus provides a general framework in which advanced hardening equations can be adopted    in the work presented in this  several strain rate potentials are examined in order to analyze their ability to model the initial stress and strain anisotropy of several orthotropic sheet materials classical quadratic and more advanced non quadratic strain rate potentials are investigated in the case of fcc and bcc polycrystals different identifications procedures are  which are taking into account the crystallographic texture and or a set of mechanical test data in the determination of the material parameters    for numerical simulation of sheet metal forming more and more advanced phenomenological functions are  to model the anisotropic yielding the latter can be described by an adjustment of the coefficients of the yield function or the strain rate potential to the polycrystalline yield surface determined  crystal plasticity and x ray measurements several strain rate potentials were examined by the present authors and compared in order to analyse their ability to model the anisotropic behaviour of materials  the methods described above to determine the material parameters following that a specific elastic plastic time integration scheme was developed and the strain rate potentials were implemented in the fe code comparison of the previously investigated potentials is continued in this  in terms of numerical predictions of cup drawing for different bcc and fcc materials the identification procedure is shown to have an important impact on the accuracy of the fe predictions    in this contribution the formability of sheet metal cut edges is investigated  a damage model classical forming limit diagrams are known not to apply properly to the cut edges however with mild steels the sheet edges usually behave better than the forming limit diagram predictions so this phenomenon has not been given sufficient attention in contrast for advanced high strength steels the cut edges exhibit reduced formability as compared to the plain sheet this effect is very sensitive to the quality of the cutting process the current investigation is aimed to evaluate the ability of available damage models to predict this effect on sample applications the gurson tvergaard needleman model is  and the material parameters for a dual phase steel are considered 1 the effect of the cutting process is described by means of initial fields of equivalent plastic strain and porosity the geometrical distribution and typical values for these  initial fields are devised based on literature numerical simulations of flat notched tensile tests are  within the fe code abaqus explicit to illustrate the impact of the initial fields on the moment and the location of the failure initiation the influence of the mesh size in the cutting affected area is also investigated the hole expansion test and a flat bending test are further simulated to investigate the influence of the cut edge    this  reviews a class of anisotropic plastic strain rate potentials based on linear transformations of the plastic strain rate tensor a new formulation is  which includes former models as particular cases and allows for an arbitrary number of linear transformations involving an increasing number of anisotropy parameters the formulation is convex and fully three dimensional thus being suitable for computer implementation in finite element codes the parameter identification procedure uses a micromechanical model to generate evenly distributed reference points in the full space of possible loading modes material parameters are determined for several anisotropic fcc and bcc sheet metals and the gain in accuracy of the new models is demonstrated for the considered materials increasing the number of linear transformations leads to a systematic improvement of the accuracy up to a number of five linear transformations the  model fits very closely the predictions of the micromechanical model in the whole space of plastic strain rate directions the r values which are not directly  in the identification procedure served for the validation of the models and to demonstrate their improved accuracy     in this  we investigate the springback behavior of several advanced high strength sheet steels trip dual phase ferrite bainite with thicknesses up to 4 mm samples were tested by means of the bending under tension but test the but has been extensively applied in the literature to relatively thin 1 mm and thinner sheet metals for automotive applications the applicability of several guidelines from the literature was investigated in this work in the context of thick advanced high strength steel ahss sheets and  a sample width of 12 mm the monotonic decrease of springback as back force increased was confirmed for this category of sheet steels and a general trend for the non linear influence of the tool radius was observed with the selected sample width the effect of the secondary curvature was negligible conclusions and simple guidelines are drawn from the analysis with industrial sheet forming applications in mind    the aim of this work is to develop a dislocation density based model for if and dp steels that incorporates details of the microstructure evolution at the grain size scale the model takes into account i the contribution of the chemical composition for the prediction of the initial yield stress ii the description of initial texture anisotropy by incorporating grain size dependent anisotropy coefficients in hill 48 yield criterion iii the contribution of three dislocation density families that are associated with forward reverse and latent structures it reproduces the macroscopic transient behaviors observed when strain path changes occur the model is implemented in fe code in order to assess its predictive capabilities in case of industrial applications     sheet metal forming processes generally involve large deformations together with complex loading sequences in order to improve numerical simulation predictions of sheet parts forming physically based constitutive models are often required the main objective of this  is to analyze the strain localization phenomenon during the plastic deformation of sheet metals in the context of such advanced constitutive models most often an accurate prediction of localization requires damage to be considered in the finite element simulation for this purpose an advanced anisotropic elastic plastic model formulated within the large strain framework and taking strain path changes into account has been coupled with an isotropic damage model this coupling is carried out within the framework of continuum damage mechanics in order to detect the strain localization during sheet metal forming rice s localization criterion has been considered thus predicting the limit strains at the occurrence of shear bands as well as their orientation the coupled elastic plastic damage model has been implemented in abaqus implicit the application of the model to the prediction of forming limit diagrams flds provided results that are consistent with the literature and emphasized the impact of the hardening model on the strain path dependency of the fld the fully threedimensional formulation adopted in the numerical development allowed for some new results e g the out of plane orientation of the normal to the localization band as well as more realistic values for its in plane orientation     this  is a contribution to the phenomenological modeling of damage evolution in dp steels in the framework of gurson s approach it is based on recent results of x ray tomography in situ tensile tests and subsequent  dimensional metallurgical void nucleation models proposed in c landron et al scripta materialia 63 2010 973 976 a macroscopic void nucleation law for dp steels is proposed covering a wide range of stress triaxialities the respective effects of nucleation growth and coalescence are clearly separated validations with respect to experimental porosity measurements were performed for several monotonic loading cases and for  loading sequences involving large strains and strain path changes    sheet metal forming processes involve multi axial strain paths for the numerical simulation of such processes an appropriate constitutive model that properly describes material behavior at large strain is required for accurate and time effective simulations it is crucial to use plasticity models based on physics as material macroscopic behavior is closely related to the evolution of the associated microstructures accordingly a large strain work hardening phenomenological model that incorporates the intragranular microstructure evolution through a dislocation density approach is  the model is defined by a yield criterion and hardening laws that are all grain size dependent the classical hill criterion in which grain size dependency was introduced is  hardening laws are given by a combination of kinematic and isotropic contributions that respectively take into account the evolution with strain of cell blocks formed by geometrically necessary boundaries gnbs and individual dislocation cells delineated by incidental dislocation boundaries within cell blocks idbs on the  hand idbs evolution contribution is described by a modified rauch et al isotropic model which is able to describe work hardening stagnation and work softening on the other hand gnbs evolution contribution is described by a grain size dependent tensorial back stress expression  by aouafi et al 2007 to describe the plastic anisotropy and bauschinger effect moreover the  model aims to accurately predict steel behavior through an innovative approach by only changing few simply measurable microstructure data e g chemical composition grain size the predictive capabilities of the model are assessed for interstitial free if and dual phase dp steels with grain sizes varying respectively in the 8 40 µm and 1 10 µm value range different loading paths are analyzed namely the uniaxial tensile test reversal simple shear and orthogonal tests    this  investigates a recently developed elasto plastic constitutive model for this purpose the model was implemented in a commercial finite element code and was  to simulate the cross die deep drawing test deep drawing experiments and numerical simulations were conducted for five interstitial free steels and seven dual phase steels each of them having a different thickness and strength the main interest of the adopted model is a very efficient parameter identification procedure due to the physical background of the model and the physical significance of some of its parameters and state variables indeed the dislocation density grain size and martensite volume fraction explicitly enter the model s formulation although the overall approach is macroscopic for the dual phase steels only the chemical composition and the average grain sizes were measured for the martensite and ferrite grains as well as the martensite volume fraction the mild steels required three additional tensile tests along three directions in order to describe the plastic anisotropy information concerning the transient mechanical behavior after strain path changes reverse and orthogonal was not collected for each material but for only  material of each family of steels if dp based on previous works available in the literature this minimalistic experimental base was  to feed the numerical simulations for the twelve materials that were confronted to deep drawing experiments in terms of thickness distributions the results suggested that the accuracy of the numerical simulations is very satisfactory in spite of the scarce experimental input data additional investigations indicated that the modeling of the transient behavior due to strain path changes may have a significant impact on the simulation results and that the adopted approach provides a simple and efficient alternative in this regard   abstract in this  anisotropic strain rate potentials based on linear transformations of the plastic strain rate tensor were reviewed in general terms this type of constitutive models is suitable for application in forming simulations particularly for finite element analysis and design codes based on rigid plasticity convex formulations were  to describe the anisotropic behavior of materials for a full 3 d plastic strain rate state 5 independent compnts for incompressible plasticity the 4th order tensors containing the plastic anisotropy coefficients for orthotropic symmetry were specified the method recommended for the determination of the coefficients  experimental mechanical data for sheet materials was discussed the formulations were shown to be suitable for the constitutive modeling of fcc and bcc cubic materials moreover these  strain rate potentials called srp2004 18p and srp2006 18p led to a description of plastic anisotropy which was similar to that provided by a generalized stress potential  recently yld2004 18p this suggests that these strain rate potentials are pseudo conjugate of yld2004 18     in the expanding context of device miniaturization forming processes of ultra thin sheetmetals are gaining importance numerical simulation of these processes requires accurate material modeling in this study both the phenomenological modeling approach and the crystal plasticity finite element method cpfem are considered theoretical definitions of both models numerical implementation as well as their parameter identification procedures are outlined subsequently they are compared on a  to  basis mainly with regards to their ability to predict mechanical responses for a variety of strain loading paths    with a view to environmental economic and safety concerns car manufacturers need to design lighter and safer vehicles in ever shorter development times in recent years high strength steels hss like interstitial free if steels which have higher ratios of yield strength to elastic modulus are increasingly  for sheet metal parts in automotive industry to meet the demands moreover the application of sheet metal forming simulations has proven to be beneficial to reduce tool costs in the design stage and to optimize current processes the finite element method fem is quite successful to simulate metal forming processes but accuracy largely depends on the quality of the material properties provided as input to the material model common phenomenological models roughly consist in the fitting of functions on experimental results and do not provide any predictive character for different metals from the same grade therefore the use of accurate plasticity models based on physics would increase predictive capability reduce parameter identification cost and allow for robust and time effective finite element simulations for this purpose a 3d physically based model at large strain with dislocation density evolution approach was presented in iddrg2009 by the authors 1 this model allows the description of work hardening s behavior for different loading paths i e uni axial tensile simple shear and bauschinger tests taking into account several data from microstructure i e grain size texture etc the originality of this model consists in the introduction of microstructure data in a classical phenomenological model in order to achieve work hardening s predictive character for different metals from the same grade indeed thanks to a microstructure parameter set for an interstitial free steel it is possible to describe work hardening behavior for different loading paths of other if steels by only changing the mean grain size and the chemical composition during sheet metal forming processes local material points may experience multi axial and multi path loadings before simulating actual industrial parts automotive manufacturers use validation tools e g the cross die stamping test such typical stamping tests enable the evaluation of a complex distribution of strains the work described is an implementation 2 of a 3d dislocation based model in abaqus explicit and its validation on a finite element fe cross die model in order to assess the performance and relevance of the 3d dislocation based model in the simulation of industrial forming applications the results of thinning profiles predicted along several directions and the strain distribution were obtained and compared with experimental results for if steels with grain sizes varying in the 8 22 μm value range    in the automotive industry heat treatment of compnts is implicitly related to distortion this phenomenon is particularly obvious in the case of gears because of their typical and precise geometry even if distortion can be anticipated to an extent by experience it remains complex to comprehend this  presents an approach to estimate the distortion based on the idea of a distortion potential taking into account not only geometry but also the manufacturing process history then the idea is developed through simulation and experiments including annealing to understand the impact of residual stress on gear distortion in an industrial case study    heat treatment is widely  in automotive industry to improve mechanical properties of workpieces it also generates side effects such as geometrical distortions scientific literature and experience show that the manufacturing process chain has an influence on heat treatment distortion the purpose of the presented work is to experimentally determine the influence of each pre heat treatment step on gear distortion residual stress is being neutralized and by comparison connections between gear teeth geometry and manufacturing step are obtained as a consequence non conformities roots can be determined more easily thanks to this diagnosis tool      large strain hardening is the main material description ingredient for cold bulk forming process simulations hardening identification of large strains is a trade off between cost standardization and the ability to represent the experiment but there are no standard procedures to date in this  approach large strains larger than 1 are reached  an industrial wire drawing process and measured data for identification are obtained from standard tensile tests fast semi analytical post processing was possible despite the significant process inherited strain heterogeneity the parameters of state of the art hardening models were identified and the robustness was demonstrated to reach far beyond the strain level attained in the experiments as a consequence accurate and robust large strain hardening modelling was achieved from standard tensile test acquisition by  industrial wire drawing pre strains    heat treatments could create local or global distortions on workpieces finishing operations often costly are then necessary to respect the required functional tolerances in the long term our objective is to optimize first steel grade and heat treatment then to adjust the numerical simulation models in that way the heat treatment distortions on c ring test parts obtained for an ascometal steel grade vertically gas quenched are qualified and quantified by a dimensional analysis in this article we focus on part measurement and data processing strategies then we present an approach to correlate the experimental results with simulations s    to develop net shape parts by forging process planing must take design production heat treatment and control difficulties into account the earliest it s possible in this perspective we propose to present an aspect of our work made in collaboration with an industry which deals with the dimensional control of the functionality of forged straight bevel gear for car differentials to study the functionality of the gear we have split it up into entities which could be looked from different views designer manufacturer metallurgist the metrologist is interested in the geometry of the entities after the measurement on coordinate measuring machine the development of a software enable us to obtain the standard deviations of gears by analysing the position defaults or the intrinsic defaults of all entities this new approach enables to qualify the whole process planning then the development reported in this  deals with the eccentricity between the net shape teeth and the assembly surfaces manufactured before heat treatment    we present a mathematical method for identifying separating and quantifying the 3d significant distortions measurement of a gas quenched c ring type sample is performed by a coordinate measuring machine cmm quenching simulation is d with the commercial software forge 2008 ttt after comparisons we notice that the distortions and their tendencies are the same but not exactly the amplitudes we only focus on distortions which have a physical origin like the pincers opening often observed in the literature as a first explanation we underline the role of phase transformations and volume dilatation of the steel during quenching    tolerance verification permits to check the product conformity and to verify assumptions made by the designer for conformity assessment the uncertainty associated with the values of the measurands must be known in the iso ts 17450 part 2 the notion of the uncertainty is generalized to the specification and the verification the uncertainty is divided into correlation uncertainty specification uncertainty and measurement uncertainty correlation uncertainty characterizes the fact that the intended functionality and the controlled characteristics may not be perfectly correlated therefore we propose a new specified characteristics based on the statistical tolerancing approach which is directly in relationship with the design intent the probability distribution of maximum range of the transmission error the transmission error is the main source of vibratory and acoustic nuisances and the evaluation of this characteristic based on 3d acquisition by monte carlo simulation and tooth contact analysis moreover the measurement uncertainty of the evaluation of this characteristic is estimated by monte carlo simulation    process control in forging industry is essential to ensure a better quality of the product with a lower cost at the end of the manufacturing process to control the process a number of key parameters must be monitored to prevent product or forgingplan deviations this  will illustrate how a variation in a process parameter can create product specifications deviations and how key parameters influence product final state the illustration work is d on a part obtained via hot forging an analysis is made on product parameters such as geometry by varying the key process parameter values previously determined from a created methodology this later is represented as adecision support system that connects product specifications geometry absence of defects or other forging specifications tool wear involved energy to the process parameters    energy saving has become a real issue in process management and has led to the analysis of the energy consumption of forging machines for the purpose of optimization this study focuses on the amount of energy lost due to machine behaviour during the forming process a spring mass damping model of the machine and tools system is associated with a billet model to describe hammer forming operations only during the forging phase themodel parameters are identifiedwith experimental measurements of process variables during a stroke providing parameters specifically adapted to the machine tools system then model predictions are validated by the experimental upsetting of steel and aluminium billets the model accurately predicts forging process variables for consecutive blows with different materials the decrease in process efficiency and the evolution from inelastic to elastic blows after several strokes on the same billet are also predicted by the model this methodology provides a new tailored solution that enables forging manufacturers to predict the forging energy consumption of their own machines the approach developed in this work concerns gravity drop hammers but is also transferable to other energy driven machines    to ensure the gear precision industries need a coherent model to express to analyse and to check geometrical specifications most gear tolerance representations are directly driven by the convenience of dimensional metrology and not by the convenience of the set of activities of the tolerancing process therefore to ensure the coherence of all tolerancing process activities there is a necessity to develop a complete gear tolerance model which should represent standard tolerance practices be integrated in the computer aided systems of design manufacturing and metrology be controlled by cmm and support automated tolerance analysis the  model extends capabilities of a vectorial dimensioning tolerancing model in order to satisfy the four requirements this model is based on geospelling 1 its coherence is illustrated by  applications gear tolerance analysis and gear tolerance verification by cmm        in automotive industry heat treatment of compnts is implicitly related to distortion this phenomenon is particularly obvious in the case of gearbox parts because of their typical geometry and precise requirements even if distortion can be anticipated to an extent by experience it remains complex to comprehend scientific literature and industrial experience show that the whole manufacturing process chain has an influence on final heat treatment distortions this  presents an approach to estimate the influence of some factors on the distortion based on the idea of a distortion potential taking into account not only geometry but also the manufacturing process history then the idea is developed through experiments on an industrial manufacturing process to understand the impact of residual stress due to machining on shaft bending and teeth distortion during heat treatment instead of being measured residual stress is being neutralized by comparing lots between each other connections between gear teeth geometry and manufacturing steps before heat treatment are obtained as a consequence geometrical nonconformities roots can be determined more easily thanks to this diagnosis tool and corrective actions can be applied secondly the influence of product geometry on bending is experimentally considered moreover metallurgical observations enable to explain the influence of workpieces geometry on shaft bending thanks to the obtained results process and product recommendations to decrease shafts bending are      a workpiece is considered as long when  dimension is larger than the  others for example railways or guides of manufacturing machines the customers requirements evolutions asks the question of workpieces end parts straightness this  deals with the means to measure and correct the straightness a way to prevent flaws in adapting the process and it is especially focused on improving quality for the end parts of the long workpiece at first to get the right measure of the straightness we take into account the fact that the workpiece is deformable consequently we assumed the hypothesis that the measured straightness is composed of the intrinsic straightness and the elastic  then an approach was developed in order to measure any straightness secondly after getting the proof that the measures are reliable the correction of the straightness has been studied the method of semi automated straightening has been developed in order to improve the productivity some experiments have been realized and the results have been compared to the theoretical s the conclusions will help to find ways to modify the process in order to prevent the flaws of straightness of long workpieces    cross wedge rolling cwr is a metal forming process used in the automotive industry  of its applications is in the manufacturing process of connecting rods cwr transforms a cylindrical billet into a complex axisymmetrical shape with an accurate distribution of material this preform is forged into shape in a forging die in order to improve cwr tool lifecycle and product quality it is essential to understand tool wear evolution and the physical phenomena that change on the cwr process due to the resulting geometry of the tool when undergoing tool wear in order to understand cwr tool wear behavior numerical simulations are necessary nevertheless if the simulations are performed with the cad geometry of the tool results are limited to solve this difficulty  numerical simulations with forge were performed  the real geometry of the tools both up and lower roll at  different states 1 before starting lifecycle and 2 end of lifecycle the tools were 3d measured with atos triple scan by gom  optical 3d measuring techniques the result was a high resolution point cloud of the entire geometry of the tool each 3d point cloud was digitalized and converted into a stl format the geometry of the tools in a stl format was input for the 3d simulations both simulations were compared defects of products obtained in simulation were compared to main defects of products found industrially  main defects are a surface defects on the preform that are not fixed in the die forging operation and b preform bent no longer straight with  possible impacts on the  hand that the robot cannot grab it to take it to the forging stage on the other hand an unfilled section in the forging operation    magnetic parts are usually composed of a stack of electrical steel laminations to reduce the eddy current losses however for cost reasons or for specific applications the magnetic core can be made from massive steel and thus manufactured with adapted processes such as forging such process may lead to inhomogeneous and degraded magnetic properties therefore this study proposes a specific device for characterizing magnetic properties of samples which are to be representative of a massive part the measure is based on the faraday s equation to determine the magnetic flux density and the hall effect to estimate the magnetic field inside the sample practically this is realized with classical compnts such as hall probes a secondary winding and an electromagnet device however their combination is unique to perform magnetic characterization on massive samples which are less affected by the sampling technique and may have anisotropic properties the device is dimensid thanks to fe simulation and validated according repeatability sensitivity and trueness analysis eventually the characterization is performed on samples with different material parameters showing the effect of the grain size on the specific losses the expected effect of the grain flow on magnetic properties is however not proven yet    during the recent years the relationship between customers and suppliers turned to a partnership relation that s why the supplier had to change his skills in order to control all the manufacturing process of his products i e from the conception to the realization in this context blacksmiths developed a new range of workpieces called net shape i e their functional surfaces are achieved by forging thus eliminating the following reworking machining operations new needs appeared in the forging industry like the precision monitoring this control aims at certifying that the workpiece has the required geometrical measurements but also to better understand every manufacturing process steps in order to evaluate step by step the manufacturing process and the obtained workpiece functionality it is necessary to accurately choose the measurand without to question the workpiece tolerance and the manufacturing process in this work the choice of the measurand to check a forged net shape bevel pinion for automobile differential is dwelt framework of  goals firstly the measured surface must be representative of a meshing this implies the study of the pinion s normalized parameters and the way to evaluate them secondly it has to allow a better understanding of the manufacturing process in order to improve it the new methodology developed in this  requires the use of a coordinate measuring machine this method is more suitable to measure the functional surfaces the results analysis is carried out thanks to a mathematical vector approach thus it allows the dissociation of the influence once it has been identified of each physical or technological phenomenon which is representative of the workpiece functionality or the manufacturing process the study of the pinion after each manufacturing process step enables to better understand the physical phenomena involved in order to develop the mathematical model describing their effects initially just a qualitative study of some manufacturing process steps has been analyzed    the present  focuses the modelling and the simulation of a direct thixoextrusion test achieved on c38 semi solid steel to validate the modelling and the simulation it is important to get various experimental informations during the test and to correlate them with simulated results in a previous  becker et al 2008 the macro and micro structure

determined i  literature results and ii to match various experimental measurements obtained during the test and described in becker et al 2008 such as the die temperature during the test and the load displacement curve comparisons between experimental and simulated reveal the presence of complex temperature field and the presence of zs having very low viscosities these zs contribute actively to the semi solid material flow    the author presents an approach to study an innovative manufacturing process developed to produce composite parts with new geometrical possibilities the aim of this first study is to understand the motions of fibers during the forming of this kind of composite parts and to explore the feasibility of this forming process by an experimental analysis and fem simulations with forge3 the reliability of the simulation tool ans its potential never exploited in this area will be evaluated    forging in semi solid state significantly extends the possibilities of classical hot forging in order to fully exploit its potential the process requires a specific and demanding environment penalizing its industrial deployment in this context an alternative route is  in the  process semi solid zs at the heart of the material coexist with surrounding solid zs within the part the outcome is an optimized process where the benefits of thixoforging are reached at a significant extent within the classical process framework of hot forging the  investigates this proposal up to a full scale proof of concept in an industrial setting    this work presents a study d on

steel behaviour and certainly for every semi solid metallic materials these thermal exchanges hide other parameters effect like for example the strain rate influence this  tries to determine the influence of these  parameters by  a new extrusion device on a hydraulic press this new tools conception annihilated the influence of the decrease of the punch speed before stopping and permitted to have a constant speed during the experiment this work also deals with the homogeneous flow during thixoforming of steel and shows the importance to couple initial temperature of the slug with punch speed this  presents different conditions which permitted to have a homogeneous flow by keeping a low load    the present  focuses on a new concept of evaluation of a performance index of hot forging dies through the combination of a process behaviour model and a reliability approach analysis of the forging process the process behaviour is modelled and simulated  the computer aided engineering forge tool that allowed optimizing the forging parameters and determining the stresses and strains together with temperatures during the forging process and also identifying the factors affecting the

sensitivity of the variations in the random values of the input parameters of the forging process the concept of this contribution has been applied to real industrial dies  to forge automotive steering levers produced in the forging workshop of the ferrovial company of annaba in algeria the performance index is given by the number of forged parts corresponding to the reliability index of the dies before failure occurs    steel thixoforging is an innovative semi solid forming process it allows the manufacturing of complex parts and minimises the forming load this work aims to identify and characterise the main feature zs of a thixoforging part the material flow and the forging load are dependent on the thixoforging speed the tool temperature and the initial temperature of the slug the data are obtained for c38 thixoforging steel a specific extrusion tool was designed that integrates the heating of the tool and the slug this tool was set up on a high speed hydraulic press this work highlights the effects of heat exchange on the microstructure the internal flow and the mechanical characteristics of thixoforging material these heat exchanges depend primarily on the working speed and tool temperature the internal flow is composed of three distinct zs among them only semisolid z is observed during working the microstructures of thixoforming c38 steel consist of ferrite pearlite and bainite    process control in forging industry is essential to ensure a better quality of the product with a lower cost at the end of the manufacturing process to control the process a

thixoforging process offers important perspectives especially steel thixoforging it is on the way of industrial development between casting and forging process previous works have illustrated the importance many parameters such as steel grade slide speed slug and tool temperature on the geometry from thixoforging part and of the forming load this  completes the previous results it presents an analysis from mechanical resistance of samples extracted of from thixo extrusion parts on a high speed hydraulic press this strength investigation is correlated with metallurgical analysis macrograph analyses allow identifying the material yield during the process and the different phases    the behavior of aluminum alloy to deformation is strongly influenced by the morphology of the microstructure this  illustrates several experimental research activities for thixoextrusion of 7075 aluminum alloy being carried out within the arts et métiers paristech of metz inductive re heating of the aluminum billet is the method to enable the desired liquid fraction for thixoextrusion experimental results show that after induction reheating the solid particles obtained has globular shape and homogeneous dimension a sample obtained from a direct extruded bar is inserted in a die and thixoextruded after reheating in semisolid state in laboratory experiments the temperature it was directly controlled applying thermocouples for temperature measurements in the slug and also in the die the experimental tests were made for  different working speeds on the mechanical eccentric press the preliminary experimental results on extrusion load and microstructure evolution of the product are reported these results will contribute to implementing the specific boundary condition of the

real sales at a random selling price based on the becker degroot marschak bdm mechanism revealed consumers wtp in three different information conditions blind tasting label examination tasting and label examination results show that sensory characteristics and label information influence differently french and german consumers they also reveal that appellation of origin information is of little value outside the country of origin for middle range wines moreover it appears that the small differences observed in mean wtp for each wine in each country and information condition do not result from consumers lack of discrimination participants in both samples display strong individual preferences however being very heterogeneous these preferences tend to cancel out when individual wtp are

these events and of the producers of these same events by studying their declarations and by meeting them to interview them we have analysed their motivations we have finally come to establish the relativity of the legitimation of comics both for their quality and the number of the individuals concerned despite the fact that a generational phenomenon has been given prominence in the evolution of the status and the recognition of comics we can conclude that the acquisition of a semi legitimacy to employ jean louis fabiani s own word by the ninth art is more of a fact than a dynamic process in development    thixoforming of steels poses challenges due to the high temperatures involved and the lack of understanding of thermomechanical behavior the volume fractions of the liquid and solid

a direct extruded bar is inserted in a die for reheating in semisolid state and thixoextrusion during the experimental re heating process the temperature was directly controlled by  thermocouples for temperature measurements in the sample and also in the die the influence of different working ram speeds and reheating temperature on the microstructure evolution was studied by optical microscopy the experimental results on extrusion load and microstructure evolution of the compnt are reported    steel thixoforging process combines the advantages of performing parts having highlycomplex shapes and good mechanical properties these advantages result from the shear thinning flow behaviour of semi solids due to microstructure changes during the material deformation many parameters such as steel grade raw speed slug temperature tool temperature influence the steel thixoforging process in this work we are interested in analysing the influence of thermal conditions as well as ram speed on the flow behaviour and the microstructure of the final parts to do so thixo extrusion tests on a high speed hydraulic press were performed on c38 steels  different ram speeds and different temperatures for the tools the temperature is measured in the die close to the tool material interface during the whole process correlations between the temperature measurements the flow profile and the

successive comparisons between calculated and measured temperatures within the die    since always industry minimizes manufacturing process plan and increases mechanical behaviour in this topic the thixoforging process offers important perspectives especially steel thixoforging it is on the way of industrial development between casting and forging process previous works have illustrated the importance many parameters such as steel grade slide speed slug and tool temperature on the this  completes the previous results it presents an analysis from mechanical resistance of samples extracted

process and the different phases    this article presents the outcomes of  thixo extrusion backward and forward to produce tubes in low carbon steel grade sae1006 c05 according to the literature data the semisolid state of this steel required for thixoforging is very difficult to obtain and has never been studied for this type of shaping the experimental tests involve  an inductive heating and a flashless forging process this work shows the route and possibility to obtain a usable semisolid by inductive heating for thixoforging of this steel grade it shows by simulation the validation steps before the shaping and the forming constraints a geometrical analysis of the parts revealed the good dimensional performance of thixoforging processes with high repeatability and a good microstructure such thixoforged tubes extend the dimensional limits of the tube wall thickness as compared to the case of conventional forging in  step and in the framework of a typical industrial installation these results could be integrated into a knowledge management system of thixoforging to identify new possibility of compnts    several problems in signal processing and machine learning can be casted as optimization problems in many cases they are of large scale nonlinear have constraints and may be nonsmooth in the unknown parameters there exists plethora of fast algorithms for smooth convex optimization but these algorithms are not readily applicable to nonsmooth problems which has led to a considerable amount of research in this direction in this  we propose a general algorithm for nonsmooth bound constrained convex optimization problems our algorithm is instance of the so called augmented lagrangian for which theoretical convergence is well established for convex problems the  algorithm is a blend of superlinearly convergent limited memory quasi newton method and proximal projection operator the initial promising numerical results for total variation based image deblurring show that they are as fast as the best existing algorithms in the same class but with fewer and less sensitive tuning parameters which makes a huge difference in practice    with the progress of adaptive optics systems ground based telescopes acquire images with improved resolutions however compensation for atmospheric turbulence is still partial which leaves good scope for digital restoration techniques to recover fine details in the images a blind image deblurring algorithm for a single long exposure image is proposed which is an instance of maximum a posteriori estimation posed as constrained non convex optimization problem a view of sky contains mainly  types of sources point like and smooth extended sources the algorithm takes into account this fact explicitly by imposing different priors on these compnts and recovers  separate maps for them moreover an appropriate prior on the blur kernel is also considered the resulting optimization problem is solved by alternating minimization the initial experimental results on synthetically corrupted images are promising the algorithm is able to restore the fine details in the image and recover the point spread

fundamental technology research demonstrated the feasibility for certain conditions these works has foc on different steel grades e g c38 m2 different tools and their materials due to specific thermal

deformation process simulation etc today it is necessary to continue the development by realizing technological demonstrators integrating some industrial constraints like production rate and costs but it is also necessary to identify and define the field of application of this process and its limits in terms of materials tools cadence forming speed etc the major difficulties are the interactions and the coupling of these various parameters and conditions of this forming process making it difficult to understand the mechanisms of thixoforging in this context a new steel grade was tested and studied this sae 1006 grade is deemed difficult to thixo forge due to its high melting point the selected part geometries are not feasible with conventional forging the present study reports the first

of childhood morbidity from chronic disease as measured by school absences emergency department visits and hospitalizations1 many scientific advances have improved our understanding of asthma and our ability to manage and control it effectively however in children 5 years and younger the clinical symptoms of asthma are variable and non specific furthermore neither airflow limitation nor airway inflammation can be assessed routinely in this age group for this reason to aid in the diagnosis of asthma in young children a symptoms only descriptive approach that includes the definition of

global strategy for asthma management and prevention in children 5 years and younger an effort has been made to present the special challenges that must be taken into account in managing asthma in children during the first 5 years of life including difficulties with diagnosis the efficacy and safety of drugs and drug delivery systems and the lack of data on new therapies approaches to these

innovative technology for near net shape production ofcompnts where the metallic alloys are processed in the semi solid state taking advantage of the thixotropic behavior of alloys in the semi solid state significant progress has been made in semi solid processing however the consequences of such behavior on the flow during thixoforming are still not completely understood to explore and better understand the influence of the different parameters on material flow during thixoextrusion process thixoextrusion experiments were performed  the low carbon steel c38 the billet was partially melted at high solid fraction effects of various process parameters including the initial billet temperature the temperature of die the punch speed during process and the presence of a ceraspray layer at the interface of tool and billet were investigated through experiments and simulation after analyzing the results thus obtained it was identified that the aforementid parameters mainly affect thermal exchanges between die and part the ceraspray layer not only plays a lubricant role but also acts as a thermal barrier at the interface of tool and billet furthermore the thermal effects can affect the material flow which is composed of various distinct zs    the distribution of liquid at the semi solid state is  of the most important parameters for steel thixoforging it has a great influence on the viscosity of the material on the flows and finally on the final shape and mechanical properties of the thixoforged parts both ex situ and in situ 3d x ray microtomography characterizations have been carried out to determine the quantity and localization of liquid at high temperature of m2 steel slugs microtomography was first performed ex situ at room temperature on samples heated and quenched from semi solid state the specimens were also scanned in situ directly at high temperature the obtained results have been compared to 2d observations  eds technique in sem on heated and quenched specimens they showed a good correlation making both approaches very efficient for the study of the liquid zs at the semi solid state     the microstructure investigation and flow behavior during thixoforging of m2 steel parts were investigated partial remelting was performed at processing temperatures ranging from 1290 c to 1340 c corresponding to a liquid fraction range between 10 and 30 according to differential scanning calorimetry measurements and quantitative image analyses a conventional microstructure for thixoforming process was obtained spherical solid grains surrounded by liquid phase the microstructure across the heated billets was relatively homogeneous with bigger grain size near the surface successful thixoextrusion for producing parts was finally achieved at processing temperatures by investigating the microstructure and load displacement curves different mechanisms in various forming stages were     the present study aims to identify and characterize the development of microstructure and deformation characteristics of steel grades in semi solid state which is affected by the change in morphologies of microstructure at high temperature thixoextrusion tests with different combinations of forming temperature and forming speed were performed it was identified that several process parameters such as initial billet and die temperatures or forming speed affect thermal exchanges thereby influencing the microstructure evolution and material flow furthermore 2d and 3d microstructure characterization was performed on the same sample which was partial remelted and quenched reconstructed 3d images were compared with the s obtained with a scanning electron microscope and an energy dispersive spectrometry system the good agreement between 2d sem observations and 3d x ray microtomography results makes these  techniques efficient to characterize steels in the semi solid state    the distribution of liquid at the semi solid state is  of the most important parameters for steel thixoforging it has a great influence on the viscosity of the material on the flows and finally on the final shape and mechanical properties of the thixoforged parts

state   abstract semi solid forming is an effective near net shape forming process to produce compnts with complex geometry and in fewer forming steps it benefits from the complex thixotropic behaviour of semi solids however the consequences of such behaviour on the flow during thixoforming is still neither completely characterized and nor fully understood especially for high melting point alloys the study described in this  investigates thixoextrusion for c38 low carbon steel material  dies at temperatures much lower than the slug temperature four different process parameters were studied the initial slug temperature the die temperature the ram speed and the presence of a ceramic layer at the tool material interface the extruded parts were found to have an exact shape and a good surface state only if the temperature was below a certain value this critical temperature is not an intrinsic material property since its value depends on die temperature and the presence of the ceraspray layer  kinds of flow were highlighted a homogeneous flow controlled by the behaviour of the solid skeleton characterized by a positive strain rate sensitivity and a non homogeneous flow macro liquid solid phase separation dominated by the flow of the free liquid with decreasing ram speed heat losses increase so that the overall consistency of the material improves leading to apparent negative strain rate sensitivity finally some ways to optimise thixoforming are proposed    image deblurring is essential in high resolution imaging e g astronomy microscopy or computational photography shift invariant blur is fully characterized by a single point spread function psf blurring is then modeled by a convolution leading to efficient algorithms for blur simulation and removal that rely on fast fourier transforms however in many different contexts blur cannot be considered constant throughout the field of view and thus necessitates to model variations of the psf with the location these models must achieve a trade off between the accuracy that can be reached with their flexibility and their computational efficiency several fast approximations of blur have been  in the literature we give a unified presentation of these methods in the light of matrix decompositions of the blurring operator we establish the connection between different computational tricks that can be found in the litterature and the physical sense of corresponding approximations in terms of equivalent psfs physically based approximations being preferable we derive an improved approximation that preserves the same desirable low complexity as other fast algorithms while reaching a minimal approximation error comparison of theoretical properties and empirical performances of each blur approximation suggests that the  general model is preferable for approximation and inversion of a known shift variant blur      thixoforging  variant of semi solid metal processing in which the metallic alloys are processed at low liquid fraction 0 1 fl 0 3 is  to produce complex parts with high mechanical properties steel thixoforging faces more challenges as compared to that of low melting point materials due to high processing temperature and lack of understanding of the thermomechanical behavior of materials in the given conditions it is crucial to study the microstructure in the semi

correlation making both approaches very efficient for the study of the liquid zs in the semi solid state    the microstructure plays a crucial role for steel semi solid forming process and particularly for the steel thixoforging process since it determines the thixotropic flow behavior of materials in the semi solid state therefore it is necessary to well understand the microstructure evolution during high speed heating and forming classically it is investigated on a solid material quenched from semi solid state by 2d characterization techniques however the semi solid microstructure could probably not be preserved in the solid state by quenching due to complicated phase transformations or high diffusion rate of alloying elements during cooling especially at low liquid fractions in order to avoid this a new in situ technique high temperature confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm was developed and  for studying the microstructure evolution directly at high temperature the present study aims at providing an experimental investigation of the microstructure evolution on several steel grades m2 100cr6 and c38ltt during heating from the as received state to the semi solid state heating rate 200 c min and finally cooled to the solid state cooling rate 200 c min it has been found that the temperature sensitivity of liquid fraction δt δfl of these grades is much different in addition during cooling there is a significant difference in diffusion rate of alloying elements between these grades in m2 thanks to the high content of alloying elements and their low diffusion rate the semi solid temperature range is greater and its microstructure in the semi solid state could be preserved by quenching process or even at a low cooling rate on the contrary the microstructure of other steel grades 100cr6 and c38ltt in semi solid state can only be revealed by clsm at high temperature because of the lower volume fraction of alloying elements and their high diffusion rate it is very interesting to use high temperature clsm to in situ investigate the microstructure evolution in the semi solid state especially at low liquid fraction since the microstructure of m2 in the semi solid state can be reserved after cooling it is possible to identify liquid area by the post mortem examination therefore the material flow behavior of thixoforged parts could be investigated     what does it mean to be happy the vast majority of cross cultural studies on happiness have employed a western origin or weird measure of happiness that conceptualizes it as a self centered or independent high arousal emotion however research from eastern cultures particularly japan conceptualizes happiness as including an interpersonal aspect emphasizing harmony and connectedness to others following a combined emic etic approach cheung van de vijver leong 2011 we assessed the cross cultural applicability of a measure of independent happiness developed in the us subjective happiness scale lyubomirsky lepper 1999 and a measure of interdependent happiness developed in japan interdependent happiness scale hitokoto uchida 2015 with data from 63 countries representing 7 sociocultural regions results indicate that the schema of independent happiness was more coherent in more weird countries in contrast the coherence of interdependent happiness was unrelated to a country s weird ness reliabilities of both happiness measures were lowest in african and middle eastern countries suggesting these  conceptualizations of happiness may not be globally comprehensive overall while the  measures had many similar correlates and properties the self foc concept of independent happiness is weird er than interdependent happiness suggesting cross cultural researchers should attend to both conceptualizations    the work showed in this  concern the integrated design of high series mechanicals products the aim of this project is to increase products performances to reach this goal it is important to understand the context of this study first of all relations between the customer and the supplier are moving the main consequence of this change is the transfer of the design step from the customer to the supplier moreover we can observe an evolution of the forge process with the development of high dimensional quality forged compnts net shape for automotive industry our design analyse of forged parts shows the potentialities of those new process are not completely exploited today the principal reason is the bad integration of manufacture knowledge during the design step this observation led us to create an integrated design approach including manufacture and product functionality control this  is intuitive because we think it is essential to adapt our work to the application thus the method can be summarized in three main steps the analyse of existing activities the identification and knowledge acquisition to improve products and to finish the structuring and the capitalization of those knowledge we have applied the approach to differential forged gears thanks to this method we have created an original gear geometry taking in consideration forge process constraints and potentialities moreover we have highlighted the necessity to develop a specific mechanical dimensioning in parallel we have realised appraisals showed in a confidential report to collect the essential knowledge to optimize the conical gear design the method we have created was tested on  industrial project of differential design some test results on gear meshing have allowed to quantify the improvement on the nominal geometry today we are making some mechanical resistance tests to end the validation of the method    during friction stir welding process fsw a tool workpiece mechanical interaction is generated leading to forces and torques applied on the tool these forces and torques are transmitted to the welding equipment impacting its technical requirements this  presents a forces and torques analysis according to the processing parameters on the welding at constant speed stage the analysis was performed on the whole welding process windows by varying  process parameter after the other the goal of this work is to determine if and how the forces and torque could be reduced by working on the processing parameters so with lower forces and torque applied on the tool the use of a standard and flexible welding equipment allowing the welding of complex geometries could be enabled    large strain hardening is the main material description ingredient for cold bulk forming process simulations hardening identification of large strains is a trade off between cost standardization and the ability to represent the experiment but there are no standard procedures to date in this  approach large strains larger than 1 are reached  an industrial wire drawing process and measured data for identification are obtained from standard tensile tests fast semi analytical post processing was possible despite the significant process inherited strain heterogeneity the parameters of state of the art hardening models were identified and the robustness was demonstrated to reach far beyond the strain level attained in the experiments as a consequence accurate and robust large strain hardening modelling was achieved from standard tensile test acquisition by  industrial wire drawing pre strains    the present  focuses on a new concept of evaluation of a performance index of hot forging dies through the combination of a process behaviour model and a reliability approach analysis of the forging process the process behaviour is modelled and simulated  the computer aided engineering forge tool that allowed optimizing the forging parameters and determining the stresses and strains together with temperatures during the forging process and also identifying the factors affecting the die life the respective reliability mechanical model is developed and reliability simulations have been conducted  phimecasoft tool in order to evaluate the reliability index β and determine the sensitivity of the variations in the random values of the input parameters of the forging process the concept of this contribution has been applied to real industrial dies  to forge automotive steering levers produced in the forging workshop of the ferrovial company of annaba in algeria the performance index is given by the number of forged parts corresponding to the reliability index of the dies before failure occurs    to develop net shape parts by forging process planing must take design production heat treatment and control difficulties into account the earliest it s possible in this perspective we propose to present an aspect of our work made in collaboration with an industry which deals with the dimensional control of the functionality of forged straight bevel gear for car differentials to study the functionality of the gear we have split it up into entities which could be looked from different views designer manufacturer metallurgist the metrologist is interested in the geometry of the entities after the measurement on coordinate measuring machine the development of a software enable us to obtain the standard deviations of gears by analysing the position defaults or the intrinsic defaults of all entities this new approach enables to qualify the whole process planning then the development reported in this  deals with the eccentricity between the net shape teeth and the assembly surfaces manufactured before heat treatment    steel thixoforging is an innovative semi solid forming process it allows the manufacturing of complex parts and minimises the forming load this work aims to identify and characterise the main feature zs of a thixoforging part the material flow and the forging load are dependent on the thixoforging speed the tool temperature and the initial temperature of the slug the data are obtained for c38 thixoforging steel a specific extrusion tool was designed that integrates the heating of the tool and the slug this tool was set up on a high speed hydraulic press this work highlights the effects of heat exchange on the microstructure the internal flow and the mechanical characteristics of thixoforging material these heat exchanges depend primarily on the working speed and tool temperature the internal flow is composed of three distinct zs among them only semisolid z is observed during working the microstructures of thixoforming c38 steel consist of ferrite pearlite and bainite    we present a mathematical method for identifying separating and quantifying the 3d significant distortions measurement of a gas quenched c ring type sample is performed by a coordinate measuring machine cmm quenching simulation is d with the commercial software forge 2008 ttt after comparisons we notice that the distortions and their tendencies are the same but not exactly the amplitudes we only focus on distortions which have a physical origin like the pincers opening often observed in the literature as a first explanation we underline the role of phase transformations and volume dilatation of the steel during quenching    tolerance verification permits to check the product conformity and to verify assumptions made by the designer for conformity assessment the uncertainty associated with the values of the measurands must be known in the iso ts 17450 part 2 the notion of the uncertainty is generalized to the specification and the verification the uncertainty is divided into correlation uncertainty specification uncertainty and measurement uncertainty correlation uncertainty characterizes the fact that the intended functionality and the controlled characteristics may not be perfectly correlated therefore we propose a new specified characteristics based on the statistical tolerancing approach which is directly in relationship with the design intent the probability distribution of maximum range of the transmission error the transmission error is the main source of vibratory and acoustic nuisances and the evaluation of this characteristic based on 3d acquisition by monte carlo simulation and tooth contact analysis moreover the measurement uncertainty of the evaluation of this characteristic is estimated by monte carlo simulation    in the cross wedge rolling process cwr plastic deformation is geared by a driving torque transmitted by friction on die surface friction plays a role which has to be further identified in this metal forming process the local contact pressure between a cylindrical billet and flat dies seems to be a relevant parameter to characterize the severe contact conditions during the rolling this  deals with an experimental measurement technology which has been designed and implemented on a semi industrial cwr test bench with plate configuration this measurement system  pin and piezoelectric sensor is presented with an analysis of the system operation and design detail characterization of systematic error and calibration tests are then explained additional tests performed on hot steel preforms allow to check the ability of the contact pressure measurement system to resist under severe operating conditions realistic results for varying temperatures are then discussed    this  focuses on the hot forging of multi material cladded work pieces  upsetting tests thecase study corresponds to gas metal arc welding cladding of a ss316l on a mild steel c15 experimentaltests

experimentally and can be predicted by the fe method  a latham and cockcroft criterion the material distribution was well simulated by the fe method in particular the effects of the frictionat die work piece interface on the crack occurrence the material distribution and to a lesser extent the forging load are well predicted however the latter was underestimated highlighting the fact thatthe effect of the dilution associated with the cladding process on the material behavior of the clad layercannot be neglected    the microstructure and flow behaviour during thixo backward extrusion of 7075 aluminium alloy were investigated reheating the steel die and the aluminium billet placed into the die at the same time  an induction furnace provides rapidly a very homogeneous microstructure suitable for thixoforming during thixoextrusion despite the high solid fraction the solid globules are weakly connected and slide over each other without any plastic deformation the flow remains quasi homogeneous resulting in homogeneous induced microstructure of the compnt     the presented work is dedicated to studying the forgeability of bimaterial cladded billet hot upsetting tests of cylindrical low carbon steel c15 billets weld cladded mig by stainless steel ss316l are experimentally and numerically studied upsetting tests with different upsetting ratios are performed in different tribology conditions at 1050 c which is within the better forgeability temperature range of both substrate and cladding materials 1 slab model and finite element simulation are conducted to parametrically study the potential forgeability of the bimaterial cladded billet the viscoplastic law is adopted to model the friction at the die billet interface the friction condition at the die billet interface has a great impact on the final material distribution forging effort and cracking occurrence with latham and cockcroft criterion the possibility and potential position of cracks could be predicted    process control in forging industry is essential to ensure a better quality of the product with a lower cost at the end of the manufacturing process to control the process a number of key parameters must be monitored to prevent product or forgingplan deviations this  will illustrate how a variation in a process parameter can create product specifications deviations and how key parameters influence product final state the illustration work is d on a part obtained via hot forging an analysis is made on product parameters such as geometry by varying the key process parameter values previously determined from a created methodology this later is represented as adecision support system that connects product specifications geometry absence of defects or other forging specifications tool wear involved energy to the process parameters    the cross wedge rolling process is commonly  for the manufacturing of shaft or for preforms being  for preliminary operation of forming cycle the presence of angular deformation produced during the rolling process is analyzed in this  this work shows some experimental results obtained on parts made of steel in semi industrial condition visioplasticity technique is  to measure the angular displacement occurring in some sections with reference to the adjacent s thus the test samples are prepared to include surface grooves filled up with quite similar steel grade after rolling process angular deformations are highlighted by observations and external deformation profile influence of surface texture of the forming area is experimentally demonstrated moreover the numerical simulation with the software forge is  to verify the adequacy between the observed phenomena and forecasts which can be obtained today conclusions about the relative influence of friction factors on the internal stresses creation are finally presented to better identify potential occurrence of these phenomena strain diagrams are  to bring out the magnitude of angular variations depending on local plastic strain on parts possible consequences for process optimization are raised     since always industry minimizes manufacturing process plan and increases mechanical behaviour in this topic the thixoforging process offers important perspectives especially steel thixoforging it is on the way of industrial development between casting and forging process previous works have illustrated the importance many parameters such as steel grade slide speed slug and tool temperature on the geometry from thixoforging part and of the forming load this  completes the previous results it presents an analysis from mechanical resistance of samples extracted of from thixo extrusion parts on a high speed hydraulic press this strength investigation is correlated with metallurgical analysis macrograph analyses allow identifying the material yield during the process and the different phases    the behavior of aluminum alloy to deformation is strongly influenced by the morphology of the microstructure this  illustrates several experimental research activities for thixoextrusion of 7075 aluminum alloy being carried out within the arts et métiers paristech of metz inductive re heating of the aluminum billet is the method to enable the desired liquid fraction for thixoextrusion experimental results show that after induction reheating the solid particles obtained has globular shape and homogeneous dimension a sample obtained from a direct extruded bar is inserted in a die and thixoextruded after reheating in semisolid state in laboratory experiments the temperature it was directly controlled applying thermocouples for temperature measurements in the slug and also in the die the experimental tests were made for  different working speeds on the mechanical eccentric press the preliminary experimental results on extrusion load and microstructure evolution of the product are reported these results will contribute to implementing the specific boundary condition of the manufacturing process to the future numerical analysis of the current project activities    energy saving has become a real issue in process management and has led to the analysis of the energy consumption of forging machines for the purpose of optimization this study focuses on the amount of energy lost due to machine behaviour during the forming process a spring mass damping model of the machine and tools system is associated with a billet model to describe hammer forming operations only during the forging phase themodel parameters are identifiedwith experimental measurements of process variables during a stroke providing parameters specifically adapted to the machine tools system then model predictions are validated by the experimental upsetting of steel and aluminium billets the model accurately predicts forging process variables for consecutive blows with different materials the decrease in process efficiency and the evolution from inelastic to elastic blows after several strokes on the same billet are also predicted by the model this methodology provides a new tailored solution that enables forging manufacturers to predict the forging energy consumption of their own machines the approach developed in this work concerns gravity drop hammers but is also transferable to other energy driven machines    thixoforming of steels poses challenges due to the high temperatures involved and the lack of understanding of thermomechanical behavior the volume fractions of the liquid and solid phases in the semi solid state are the most important parameters for such a form ing process as they aﬀect the viscosity and hence the ﬂow behavior of the material  dimensional observations might not always be suﬃcient as the size distribution and the connectivity of phases cannot be obtained from associated measurements which can only be determined by three dimensional 3 d investigation this  presents the ﬁrst

aim was to compare trends in total hdl and non hdl cholesterol and the total to hdl cholesterol ratio in asian and western countries methods we pooled 458 population based studies with 82 1 million participants in 23 asian and western countries we estimated changes in mean total hdl and non hdl cholesterol and mean total to hdl cholesterol ratio by country sex and age group results since 1980 mean tc increased in asian countries in japan and south korea the tc rise was due to rising hdl cholesterol which increased by up to 0 17 mmol l per decade in japanese women in china it was due to rising non hdl cholesterol tc declined in western countries except in polish men the decline was largest in finland and norway at 0 4 mmol l per decade the decline in tc in most western countries was

in patients and their response to interventions      in the automotive industry heat treatment of compnts is implicitly related to distortion this phenomenon is particularly obvious in the case of gears because of their typical and precise geometry even if distortion can be anticipated to an extent by experience it remains complex to comprehend this  presents an approach to estimate the distortion based on the idea of a distortion potential taking into account not only geometry but also the manufacturing process history then the idea is developed through simulation and experiments including annealing to understand the impact of residual stress on gear distortion in an industrial case study    additive manufacturing am became an advanced research topic due to its ability to manufacture complex shapes but the ability to achieve predictable and repeatable shapes is critical therefore to optimize the design of an additive manufactured product tolerancing is a key issue this  focuses on geometrical quality assessment of an am product it includes a process oriented geometrical model to predict the surface roughness and dimensional deviations and a geometrical simulation tool to assess the impacts of these deviations on the geometrical behaviour of the joint an application of the approach is illustrated through a case study    this word has a double meaning geometric dimensioning and gd t is a symbolic language  to specify tolerancing the size shape orientation and location of part features gd t is a concept widely  for specifying dimensions and tolerances of parts and subassemblies of a product according to their functional requirements tolerancing is the set of activities which manage the tolerances during the product development    product service system is  way toward sustainable system development  issue of pss concerns the function allocation between the product part and the service part in architecture engineering construction function assignment to either the building or the service offered is also a strong issue the contracting owner i e paying client has to deal with this issue during the requirements definition this  proposes to tackle it through an adaptation and application of gero s function behaviour structure design concept to the requirements definition of building systems considered as pss the  fbs decomposition is illustrated on the example of a kitchen in a retirement home    in tolerancing analysis area the most various existing approaches do not take form defects of parts into consideration as high precisions assemblies cannot be analyzed with the assumption that form defects are negligible the  focuses in particular on the study of the form defects impacts on the assembly simulation and that by comparing  optimization algorithms ihlrf and quapro the study is limited firstly to the cylinders for the optimization  main types of surfaces modelling are considered difference surface based method and real model the compared models allow assessing the non interferences between cylinders with form defects potentially in contact this is in the main issue to validate a tolerance analysis approach    this  deals with tolerance allocation driven by an activity based approach its main objective is to rationally give a good indicator of the relevance of tolerances values fixed by designers taking into consideration the impacts of tolerance allocation on the manufacturing process and so the production cost several examples are given to illustrate this concept moreover this  deals with how the geometrical analysis can be carried out in this activity framework illustrated several industrial cases finally this  explains how coupled with an optimization algorithm this method can generate the best compromise between cost and high performance to illustrate the efficiency of this approach and its realization models and user interfaces based on an industrial case are given    this  proposes an optimization framework for inspection planning based on a mixed integer non linear programming minlp model in which decisions are made on what kinds of quality characteristics need which kind of inspections and where these inspections should be taken place such that total cost of production is minimized  different types of inspections containing monitoring inspection mi and conformity inspection ci are taken into account in order to validate the correctness of the model a real industrial case is studied since the size of problems is large a genetic based algorithm is developed to solve the real industrial case    tolerance verification permits to check the product conformity and to verify assumptions made by the designer for conformity assessment the uncertainty associated with the values of the measurands must be known in the iso ts 17450 part 2 the notion of the uncertainty is generalized to the specification and the verification the uncertainty is divided into correlation uncertainty specification uncertainty and measurement uncertainty correlation uncertainty characterizes the fact that the intended functionality and the controlled characteristics may not be perfectly correlated therefore we propose a new specified characteristics based on the statistical tolerancing approach which is directly in relationship with the design intent the probability distribution of maximum range of the transmission error the transmission error is the main source of vibratory and acoustic nuisances and the evaluation of this characteristic based on 3d acquisition by monte carlo simulation and tooth contact analysis moreover the measurement uncertainty of the evaluation of this characteristic is estimated by monte carlo simulation     abstract the research concerns automated generation of process plans  knowledge formalization and capitalization tools allowing designers to deal with issues and specifications of the machining domain are taken into account the main objective of the current work is to prevent designers from designing solutions that would be expensive and difficult to machine among all available solutions to achieve this goal  are distinguished the generative approach and the analogy approach the generative approach is more adapted to generate the machining plans of parts composed of numerous boring operations in interaction however generative systems have  major problems proposed solutions are often too numerous and are only geometrically but not technologically relevant in order to overcome these drawbacks  new concepts of feature and three control algorithms are developed the  presents the  new features the machining enabled geometrical feature megf and the machinable features mbf this development is the result of the separation of the geometrical and the technological data contained in  machining feature the second objective of the  is to improve the current process ascending generation pag system with control algorithms in order to limit the combinatorial explosion and disable the generation of unusable or not machinable solutions    during recent decades there has been growing awareness of human safety in the design process the purpose of this  is to review the literature on design for human safety dfhs in manufacturing systems to this end a process for systematically reviewing dfhs studies was  the authors foc in particular on the applications of design theories and methodologies dtm and design tools and techniques dtt to analyse and identify work situations in order to improve human safety in manufacturing system design the authors also tried to identify the design phases in which these dtm and dtt could be applied this research review covered s published between 1980 and 2015 and combined seven groups of terms dfhs design safety dtm dtt risk and working situation a critical analysis was also performed in view to defining a research agenda and the most prominent key actions capable of pointing out paths for future research     this  presents a framework consisting of a mathematical model and an algorithm for representation analysis and exploration of the design space in redesign problems the framework develops and extends the existing formalism of the characteristics properties model cpm and property driven design pdd a platform independent quantitative model based on formal log ic is presented to map the characteristics and properties as well as the relations and dependencies between them along with solution conditions the model is based on generalization of existing mathematical design models and is support ed by the development of an algorithm enabling property driven design the re sulting framework offers a rich and flexible syntax and vocabulary along with a mathematical and computational tool applicable to mechanical product design    in many modern manufacturing industries data that characterize the manufacturing process are electronically collected and stored in the databases due to advances in data collection systems and analysis tools data mining dm has widely been applied for quality assessment qa in manufacturing industries in dm the choice of technique to use in analyzing a dataset and assessing the quality depend on the understanding of the analyst on the other hand with the advent of improved and efficient prediction techniques there is a need for an analyst to know which tool performs best for a particular type of data set although a few review s have recently been published to discuss dm applications in manufacturing for qa this  provides an extensive review to investigate the application of a special dm technique namely support vector machine svm to solve qa problems the review provides a comprehensive analysis of the literature from various points of view as dm preliminaries data preprocessing dm applications for each quality task svm preliminaries and application results  tables and figures are also provided besides to the analyses finally conclusions and future research directions are provided    uncertainty is ubiquitous in tolerance analysis problem this  deals with tolerance analysis formulation more particularly with the uncertainty which is necessary to take into account into the foundation of this formulation it presents a brief view of the uncertainty classification aleatory uncertainty comes from the inherent uncertain nature and phenomena and epistemic uncertainty comes from the lack of knowledge a formulation of the tolerance analysis problem based on this classification its development aleatory uncertainty is modeled by probability distributions while epistemic uncertainty is modeled by intervals monte carlo simulation is employed for probabilistic analysis while nonlinear optimization is  for interval analysis    the aim of this  is to provide an overview of tolerance analysis tolerancing decisions can profoundly impact the quality and cost of product there is a strong need for increased attention to tolerance design to enable high precision assemblies to be manufactured at lower costs indeed tolerance analysis is a key element in industry for improving product quality designers want tight tolerances to assure product performance manufacturers prefer loose tolerances to reduce cost there is a critical need for a quantitative design tool for specifying tolerances tolerance analysis brings the engineering design requirements and manufacturing capabilities together in a common model where the effects of tolerance specifications on both design and manufacturing requirements can be evaluated quantitatively significant amount of literature is related to tolerancing methods summaries of state of the art the most recent developments and the future trends in tolerancing research can be found this  provides a classification of the issues from a mathematical point of view    the choice of an adapted production system is essential in today s volatile market environment for this choice the identification of common and distinct assemblies in between the product variants is of high importance this  presents four new similarity indices which are aggregated to categorize products the categorization will support the choice of an assembly system type dedicated reconfigurable or hybrid for a selection of product subassemblies when designing a new production facility on this way operational areas for a reconfigurable system can be defined the novel approach is applied to an industrial case study in automotive industry     an increased and ongoing trend to more product variety can be observed in manufacturing industries this trend implies that enterprises have to deal with more and more differing products which leads to challenges on both sides the product design and the production the improvement of production being an important factor the challenge on the side of the design department is not minor between design for manufacturing assembly and increasing demands in terms of customisation the management of highly varying products and the generation of coherent product families is of great importance this article presents a new design improvement methodology based on  physical and functional architecture similarity indices and  assembly technology similarity indices it aims to guide the designer in the analysis of product similarity the identification of product subassemblies to optimise and the choice of consistent assembly solutions for an easier product family generation and optimised production a case study from automotive industry is presented to illustrate the application of this approach     abstract tolerance analysis aims on checking whether specified tolerances enable functional and assembly requirements the tolerance analysis approaches discussed in literature are generally assumed without the consideration of parts form defects this  presents a new model to consider the form defects in an assembly simulation a metric modal decomposition mmd method is henceforth developed to model the form defects of various parts in a mechanism the assemblies including form defects are further assessed  mathematical optimization the optimization involves  models of surfaces real model and difference surface base method and introduces the concept of signed distance the optimization algorithms are then compared in terms of time consumption and accuracy to illustrate the methods and their respective applications a simplified over constrained industrial mechanism in three dimensions is also  as a case study      in the context of concurrent engineering the design of the parts the production planning and the manufacturing facility must be considered simultaneously this enables the design and development cycle to be reduced with manufacturing constraints being taken into account as early as possible thus the design phase takes into account the manufacturing constraints but these constraints must not restrict the design s creativity moreover in order to provide support to select the most suitable system for a specific process virtual manufacturing is supplemented with developments of numerical computations in this context the authors want to predict the work piece geometric more accurately quality by considering the machine limitations through the use of process simulation with reference to a particularly case study based on a 3 axis milling machine the scope of this study focuses on these geometric defects machine geometric errors and positioning errors due to fixture system   abstract this  presents a methodology to be employed in the whole process design phase including first and second processing this methodology consists of a set of steps which are characterised by an independent model this  s objective is to analyse the coherence between the different models and the coherence between the model and the objectives of each step the final stage is to develop the production plans the casting process was the first  to be analyzed casting models were created  cad software catia v5r17 and imported into the casting simulation environment magmasoft filling and solidifying processes have been simulated  different casting models in order to optimize the final configuration the machining process was modeled  the machining features concept and it was simulated  catia s advanced machining environment  machining strategies have been analyzed according to positioning strategies process engineering software was used to create the process plans and to analyze the resource allocation    to ensure the gear precision industries need a coherent model to express to analyse and to check geometrical specifications most gear tolerance representations are directly driven by the convenience of dimensional metrology and not by the convenience of the set of activities of the tolerancing process therefore to ensure the coherence of all tolerancing process activities there is a necessity to develop a complete gear tolerance model which should represent standard tolerance practices be integrated in the computer aided systems of design manufacturing and metrology be controlled by cmm and support automated tolerance analysis the  model extends capabilities of a vectorial dimensioning tolerancing model in order to satisfy the four requirements this model is based on geospelling 1 its coherence is illustrated by  applications gear tolerance analysis and gear tolerance verification by cmm    in this study we design a reliable logistics nerk based on a hub location problem which is less sensitive to disruption and it performs efficiently when disruption occurs a new mixed integer programming model is  to minimize the total sum of the nominal and expected failure costs this model considers complete and partial disruption at hubs in addition we propose a new hybrid meta heuristic algorithm based on genetic and imperialist competitive algorithms we compare the performance of the  al gorithm with a new lower bound method in terms of the cpu time and solution quality furthermore we conclude that a considerable improvement in the reliability of the net work can be achieved with only a slight increase in the total cost finally we demonstrate that the nerks designed  our model are less conservative and more robust to disruption compared with those designed based on other robustness measures    conventional machining process planning approaches are inefficient to handle the process planning complexity induced by part variety reconfigurable process planning is a new process planning approach which has been well recognized as a key enabler for current manufacturing paradigms however in the literature there is neither a comprehensive part variety representation model to support reconfigurable process planning nor a global solution framework to instruct the generation of the feasible process plans for a specific part variant therefore this  extends the concept of reconfigurable process planning to a concept of reconfigurable machining process planning which targets the process plan generation for a part family a solution framework is developed for reconfigurable machining process planning in this framework a feature based part variety model is  to represent a part family a reconfigurable machining process plan is defined as a set of modular compnts which can be configured reconfigured into the machining process plans for any part variant in the family a novel configuration approach is  to generate the process plan compnts for a specific part variant while configuring this part variant from the family the feasibility and effectiveness of the  framework and models are tested in a real case study     integrated product design and development in today s highly competitive and economically challenging world is a complex process depending upon client requirements  of the main factors contributing to the complexity of process is uncertainty due to lack of system knowledge known as epistemic uncertainty this  proposes a systematic approach to reduce epistemic uncertainty in design process in early stages of design the approach is based on ctoc and cpm to decompose the system behaviour and determine the relationships between function and structure of a system an application of the approach is demonstrated through an industrial case study   abstract the main objective in designing a product is to satisfy the required needs so the designer aims to design the product s structure based on the required function of the product therefore in the design process the link between the functional requirement and the physical structure has to be assured this  proposes an approach to help the designer in transition from function to structure to assure this link this approach uses energy flow modelling to model the system s behaviour in the framework of characteristics properties modelling cpm it is composed of a multi level modelling approach with  concurrent interlinked modelling domains functional and structural by zigzagging between these  domains in each level of the decomposition a quantitative model of the product is determined  cpm the result shows the effective modifiable parameters or required structure of the product to satisfy the required function so it can be  to design a new product as well as analysing and optimising an existing product      purpose  major problem preventing further application and benefits from additive manufacturing am nowadays is that am build parts always end up with poor geometrical quality to help improving geometrical quality for am this study aims to propose geometrical deviation identification and prediction method for am which could be used for identifying the factors forms and values of geometrical deviation of am parts design methodology approach this  applied the skin model based modal decomposition approach to describe the geometrical déviations of am and decompose them into different defect modes on that basis the approach to propose and extend defect modes was developed identification and prediction of the geometrical deviations were then carried out with this method finally a case study with cylinders manufactured by fused deposition modeling was introduced  coordinate measuring machine cmm machines with different measure methods were used to verify the effectiveness of the methods and modes proposed findings the case study results with  different cmm machines are very close which shows that the method and modes proposed by this  are very effective also the results indicate that the main geometrical defects are caused by the shrinkage and machine inaccuracy induced errors which have not been studied enough originality value this work could be used for identifying and predicting the forms and values of am geometrical deviation which could help realize the improvement of am part geometrical quality in design phase more purposefully    in order to tackle the ambiguities of geometrical product specification gps geospelling language has been developed to express the semantics of specifications a detailed syntax of geospelling is  in this  a specification is defined as a sequence of operations on the skin model the syntax is based on instructions  in computer programming language call to functions and flow control by condition and loop in geospelling the call to functions corresponds to the declaration of operations loops make it possible to manage a set of features with rigor and conditions to select features from a set   abstract tolerance analysis is a key issue in proving the compatibility of manufacturing uncertainties with the quality level of mechanical systems for rigid and isostatic systems multiple methods worst case statistical or probabilistic approaches are applicable and well established recent scientific developments have brought enhancements for rigid overconstrained systems  probabilistic and optimization based methods the consideration of nonrigid systems is more complex since a large scale numerical model must be taken into account for an accurate prediction of the quality the aim of the present  is the illustration of the probabilistic tolerance analysis approach for an industrial application involving deformable parts the distributions associated with the dimensions of the compnts were identified  real compnts collected from the assembly lines a nonlinear finite element model was  to predict the mechanical behavior a reliability analysis was performed in order to compute the defect probability and estimate the quality of the products a kriging based surrogate model was  to reduce the numerical efforts required for the reliability analysis    the statistical tolerance analysis has become a key element used in the design stage to reduce the manufacturing cost the rejection rate and to have high quality products  of the frequently used methods is the monte carlo simulation employed to compute the non conformity rate due to its efficiency in handling the tolerance analysis of over constrained mechanical systems however this simulation technique requires excessive numerical efforts the goal of this  is to improve this method by proposing a probabilistic model of gaps in fixed and sliding contacts and involved in the tolerance analysis of an assembly the probabilistic model is carried out on the clearance compnts of the sliding and fixed contacts for their assembly feasibility considering all the imperfections on the surfaces the kernel density estimation method is used to deal with the probabilistic model the  method is applied to an over constrained mechanical system and compared to the classical method regarding their computation time   abstract the goal of tolerance analysis is to verify whether design tolerances enable a mechanism to be functional the current method consists in computing a probability of failure  monte carlo simulation combined with an optimization scheme called at each iteration this time consuming technique is not appropriate for complex overconstrained systems this  proposes a transformation of the current tolerance analysis problem formulation into a parallel system probability assessment problem  the lagrange dual form of the optimization problem the number of events being very large a preliminary selective search algorithm is  to identify the most contributing events to the probability of failure value the first order reliability method form for systems is eventually applied to compute the probability of failure at low cost the  method is tested on an overconstrained mechanism modeled in three dimensions results are consistent with those obtained with the monte carlo simulation and the computing time is significantly reduced     to improve the tolerancing process in an industrial context there exists a strong need for tolerance analysis to estimate the ppm defected product per million probability of scrap in an acceptable computer time and managing the accuracy of the results the developed approaches for gear tolerance analysis based on simulation depend on the type of geometrical model the skin model representation and on the type of behavior model which impact the accuracy of the results and the computer time of the simulation therefore this  proposes a comparison of four skin model representations discrete shape discrete shape with vectorial dimensioning tolerancing vd t parametric surface parametric surface with vd t and three tooth contact analysis tca techniques based on minimization of the distance between the  discrete representations of the  teeth minimization of the distance between the  projected discrete representation in the meshing plane simulation of tangency of tooth surfaces with a continuous representation being in mesh regarding accuracy of results computation time and the adequacy with the standard tolerance practices the assessment of the accuracy of the results is based on a comparison between the numerical simulation results and the experimental results and a comparison with the literature results the assessment of the adequacy with the standard tolerance practices is based on the mapping between the parameters of the skin model representation and the standardized tolerances    this  is dedicated to integrated safety which is dealing to apply as soon as possible safe machine design principle more human in the factory is  of the main themes of the factory of the future paradigm despite of current researches on design methodologies and standards practical uses of this approach are not yet perfect in order to answer to these objectives inrs and ensam have signed a research agreement in order to gives to the machine or manufacturing systems designers structured methods models tools and so to help them during the design process this  present studies carrying out results obtained following the axis working equipment requirements preliminary design of manufacturing equipment taking account of health and safety    design for human safety is a complex issue because of the variability of human activities machines and their environment as well as the variability of possible interactions between these compnts the work situation is comprised of the means and the person s who act to carry out task s in a working environment in accordance with the conditions set for carrying out the task s the work situation can generate the hazardous conditions and undesirables events lead to harm this  deals with the work situation identifying and analyzing during design to improve safety product service system pss which is an integrated combination of products and services that shift from product and service systems to product service systems has been used the function behavior structure fbs which covers behavior is considered to include product and its utilization the interaction between pss and fbs  in present  allows considering product behaviors and its interaction with service activities this allows to distinguish the realization of functions by a product part a service part or a combination of both the analysis of this interaction is helpful for work situation analysis product and service behaviors modeling also are  in order to help this analysis the applicability of the  approach is demonstrated through the application to the power take off pto drive shaft     in this  a bi objective mixed integer linear programming bomilp model for planning of an inspection process used to detect nonconforming products and malfunctioning processors in a multi stage serial production system is presented the model involves  inter related decisions 1 which quality characteristics need what kind of inspections i e which what decision and 2 when the inspection of these characteristics should be performed i e when decision these decisions require a trade off between the cost of manufacturing i e production inspection and scrap costs and the customer satisfaction due to inevitable variations in the manufacturing systems a global robust bomilp rbomilp is developed to tackle the inherent uncertainty of the concerned parameters i e production and inspection times errors type i and ii misadjustment and dispersion of the process in order to optimally solve the presented rbomilp model a meta heuristic algorithm namely differential evolution de algorithm is combined with the taguchi and monte carlo methods the  model and solution algorithm are validated through a real industrial case from a leading automotive industry in france     the quality level of a mechanism can be evaluated a posteriori after several months by following the number of warranty returns however it is more interesting to evaluate a predicted quality level in the design stage this is  of the aims of statistical tolerance analysis a possible method consists of computing the defect probability pd expressed in ppm it represents the probability that a functional requirement will not be satisfied in mass production for assembly reasons many hyperstatic mechanisms require gaps which their functional requirements depend on the defect probability assessment of such mechanisms is not straightforward and requires advanced numerical methods this problem particularly interests the valeo w s company which experiences problems with an assembly containing gaps this  proposes an innovative methodology to formulate and compute the defect probability of hyperstatic mechanisms with gaps in  steps first a complex feasibility problem is converted into a simpler problem then the defect probability is efficiently computed thanks to system reliability methods and the m dimensional multivariate normal distribution um finally a sensitivity analysis is provided to improve the original design the whole approach is illustrated with an industrial case study but can be adapted to other similar problems        this  presents a method for parameter design of mechanical products based on a set based approach set based concurrent engineering emphasises on designing in a multi stakeholder environment with concurrent involvement of the stakeholders in the design process it also encourages flexibility in design through communication in terms of ranges instead of fixed point values and subsequent alternative solutions resulting from intersection of these ranges these alternative solutions can then be refined and selected according to the designers preferences and clients needs this  presents a model and tools for integrated flexible design that take into account the manufacturing variations as well as the design objectives for finding inherently robust solutions  qcsp transformation through interval analysis in order to demonstrate the approach an example of design of rigid flange coupling with a variable number of bolts and a choice of bolts from iso m standard has been resolved and demonstrated     in robust design the principle is to improve product quality minimizing the impacts of variations variability depends strongly on the set of explicit and implicit decisions taken during product design selection of methods processes and resources this  presents a new approach to decision making for inspection planning the  approach requirements are then emphasized as well the necessity of quality management tools integration in decision making is concluded literature review highlights that each already existent quality tools satisfies partially these requirements among these latter fmea is considered to be flexible and apt enough to be adapted to caip despite improving points to fmea are discussed and required modifications and future works are then      we present the idea of searching for x rays as a signature of the mechanism inducing the spontaneous collapse of the wave function such a signal is predicted by the continuous spontaneous localization theories which are solving the measurement problem by modifying the schrödinger equation we will show some encouraging preliminary results and discuss future plans and strategy    the vip2 experiment tests the pauli exclusion principle with high sensitivity by

the box simulates here a part of the electromagnetic reverberant environment within satellite structure in the  cross polarized configuration a dual polarized passive repeater is  for transmitting

regioselective preparation of 2 heteroarylmethylene decorated n arylpyrroles is described through a metal free mannich wittig hydroamination sequence followed by isomerization of the n arylpyrrolidine

combined with aldehydes in a redox neutral sequence leading to 2 oxazol 4 carboxylates with high functional groups tolerance while the scope of the method was delineated to primary and secondary ali phatic aldehydes as well as aromatics no racemization occurred with chiral aldehydes such as garner s hitherto unknown this process relies on the ambivalent role of n cbz α tosylglycinate ester acting as pronucleophile combining nitrogen and oxygen in a 5 membered aromatic ring 2 3h oxazols 2 oxo 2 3 dihydrooxazoles are pertinent molecules in the fields of medicinal chemistry and agrochemistry 1 as illustrated with i and ii scheme 1a with respectively antibacterial 1a and herbicidal activities 1b 2 as planar and aromatic derivatives of amino acids such as serine and threonine electron poor 2 3h oxazol 4 carboxylates esters have much promise in the aforementid fields scheme 1b however the known strategy toward 5 substituted 2 3h oxazol 4 carboxylates requires  limiting steps scheme 1 first α ketoesters are oxidized into α nosyloxy or α bromo β ketoesters then the nitrogen nucleus is introduced with methyl carbamate by nucleophilic addition in harsh conditions upon activation with p toluenesulfonic acid or silver triflate in refluxing toluene 3 within this strategy alternative routes were described by combining either α amino β ketoesters with triphosgene 1b or α diazo β ketoesters with methyl carbamate 1c beside the limited functional group tolerance displayed by these methods the assemblage and or oxidation of the acyclic compounds remain impediments to broader molecular diversity at the inception of this study was an attempt to promote the mannich coupling between dihydrocinamaldehyde 1a and n cbz α tosylglycinate ester 2 which inadvertently led to 2 3h

passive microwave 24 ghz sensors the sensors are packaged and allow the remote measurement of overpressure up to 2 1 bars their design fabrication process and packaging are detailed from the measurement of sensor scattering parameters the outstanding sensitivity of 995 mhz bar between 0 8 and 2 1 bars was achieved with the full scale measurement range of 1 33 ghz moreover the 3d radar imagery technique was applied for the remote interrogation of these sensors in electromagnetic reverberant environments the full scale dynamic range of 4 9 db and the sensitivity of 4 9 db bar between 0 7 and 1 7 bars were achieved with radar detection in a highly reflective environment these measurement results demonstrate for the first time the ability of the radar imagery technique to interrogate fully passive pressure sensors in electromagnetic reverberant environments    a new microwave fully passive chipless and packaged sensor for wireless pressure monitoring in harsh environments such as extreme temperature radioactive and or toxic environments is  in this  the sensor consists of a planar microstrip resonator which is electromagnetically coupled with a high

a  pot sequence of organocatalytic transformations delivers heteroarylmethylene substituted pyrrolidines with high stereo and enantioselectivity a mannich coupling of n heteroarylalkyne aldehydes with aldimine and an original metal free hydroamination of the resulting adducts are the key transformations of the process delivering highly functionalized molecules with high potential for synthetic applications   abstract this  analyses the impact of anodic bonding technique on the transmission loss in 23ghz pressure transducers the transducers consist of a thin high resistivity silicon membrane and a 23ghz planar resonator placed inside a cavity  types of transmission line are used here for designing the resonators probe fed coplanar lines and aperture coupled microstrip s transducers based on aperture coupled microstrip resonators and manufactured from the anodic bonding process for assembling the silicon membrane to the glass substrate are the most promising low loss solution it is actually shown that at the resonant frequency of the planar resonator the measured transmission loss in a probe fed coplanar transducer is about 4db when  bonding with the photoresist as an intermediate layer while it is only of 2 55db when applying the anodic bonding assembling process however we report for the first time that very high and unexpected transmission loss 30db occurs when

est déroulé à l issu du groupe les fondations des mathématiques au xixe siècle entre histoire philosophie épistémologie et cognition avril juin 2004    enzymatically formed oxygenated metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids pufa are of great interest for the scientific community being mediators and biomarkers in the physiological and pathological regulation of many key biological processes more recently metabolites of pufa formed through a non enzymatic free radical pathway have gained interest in diseases linked with oxidative stress thus synthetic strategies leading to the total synthesis of such metabolites are an essential field of research and this review will cover a structural presentation will discuss their biological interests and present total syntheses reported between 2008 and 2017    energy saving has become a real issue in process management and has led to the analysis of the energy consumption of forging machines for the purpose of optimization this study focuses on the amount of energy lost due to machine behaviour during the forming process a spring mass damping model of the machine and tools system is associated with a billet model to describe hammer forming operations only during the forging phase themodel parameters are identifiedwith experimental measurements of process variables during a stroke providing parameters specifically adapted to the machine tools system then model predictions are validated by the experimental upsetting of steel and aluminium billets the model accurately predicts forging process variables for consecutive blows with different materials the decrease in process efficiency and the evolution from inelastic to elastic blows after several strokes on the same billet are also predicted by the model this methodology provides a new tailored solution that enables forging manufacturers to predict the forging energy consumption of their own machines the approach developed in this work concerns gravity drop hammers but is also transferable to other energy driven machines    under condition of oxidative stress free radical mediated peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids generates in vivo cyclic metabolites like the isoprostanes neuroprostanes dihomo isoprostanes isofuranes among a large number of key products which participate in many pathophysiological processes these metabolites display a wide range of biological actions and some of them are now the most reliable indicators of oxidative stress in humans in this review we will discuss several key points of our understanding of those cyclic polyunsaturated fatty acids derivatives going from multi step syntheses analytical chemistry and biological activities    polyunsaturated fatty acids pufa are oxidized in vivo under oxidative stress through free radical pathway and release cyclic oxygenated metabolites which are commonly classified as isoprostanes and isofurans the discovery of isoprostanes goes back twenty five years compared to fifteen years for iso furans and great many are discovered the biosynthesis the nomenclature the chemical synthesis of furanoids from a linolenic acid ala c18 3 n 3 arachidonic acid aa c20 4 n 6 adrenic acid ada 22 4 n 6 and docosahexaenoic acid dha 22 6 n 3 as well as their identification and implication in biological systems are highlighted in this review    lipase b from candida antarctica calb has been selected as the most suitable enzyme to catalyze the regioselective monoacetylation of 1 5 diol isoprostane intermediate  vinyl acetate as an acyl transfer reagent in thf we next applied this reaction on linear 2 substituted 2 20 disubstituted 1 5 pentanediols and cyclic 2 3 disubstituted 1 5 pentanediols to rationalize the regioselectivity observed molecular docking simulations were performed    the first total synthesis of 15 d2t isoprostane is described 9s 15s 15 d2t isop 1 and 11r 15r 15 epi 15 e2t isop 2 have been obtained in 15 steps from orthogonally protected enantiopure bicycle 3 key features include an easy introduction of the cis side chains via ozonolysis a highly enzymatic chemical differentiation of a non meso 1 5 diol and the use of a common synthetic intermediate allowing a stereodivergent approach to the target mols    since the beginning of the 1990 s diverse types of metabolites originating from polyunsaturated fatty acids formed under autooxidative conditions were discovered known as prostaglandin isomers or isoprostanoids originating from arachidonic acid neuroprostanes from docosahexaenoic acid and phytoprostanes from α li nolenic acid proved to be prevalent in biology the syntheses of these compounds by organic chemists and the development of sophisticated mass spectrometry methods has boosted our understanding of the isoprostanoid biology in recent years it has become accepted that these molecules not only serve as markers of oxidative damage but also exhibit a wide range of bioactivities in addition isoprostanoids have emerged as indicators of oxidative stress in humans and their environment this review explores in detail the isoprostanoid chemistry and biology that has been achieved in the past three decades    a wide variety of metabolic products of polyunsaturated fatty acids is of paramount importance for improving our medical knowledge in the field of oxidized lipids  novel metabolites of n 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids 8 f3t isop and 10 f4t neurop as well as a deuterated derivativethereof were synthesized based on an acetylenic intermediate an original approach achieved lateral chain insertion of 8 f3t isop by a ring closing alkyne metathesis semi reduction strategy together with a temporary tether    phytoprostanes phytops represent non enzymatic metabolites of α linolenic acid ala the essential omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid pufa derived from plants phytops are present in the plant kingdom and represent endogenous mediators capable of protecting cells from oxidative stress damages in plants recently it was found that such metabolites are present in cooking oil in high quantities and also that b 1 phytops protect immature neurons from oxidant injury and promote differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitors through ppar γ activation we report a novel and facile synthesis of natural 2 3 substituted cyclopenten phytops 16 b 1 phytop and 9 l 1 phytop our strategy is based on reductive alkylation at the 2 position of 1 3 cyclopentanedi  a recent protocol developed by ramachary et al and on a cross coupling metathesis to access conjugate dien system in conclusion this strategy permitted access to b 1 and l 1 phytops in a relative short sequence process and afford the possibility to easily develop analogs of phytops    phytoprostanes phytops and phytofurans phytofs are isoprostanoids that result from the peroxidation of α linolenic acid and are biomarkers of oxidative stress in plants and humans these compounds exhibit several interesting biological activities e g neuroprotection and anti inflammatory activities the aim of this research was to add value to coffee pulp cp cocoa husk ch and cocoa pod husk cph by identifying and quantifying phytops and phytofs by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry the contents of phytops and phytofs in cp ch and cph were respectively 654 6 474 3 and 179 9 and 543 2 278 0 and 393 8 ng per g dry weight dw the main phytop found in cp 171 37 ng per g dw and cph 37 12 ng per g dw was 9 epi 9 f1t phytop while ent 9 l1t phytop was the most abundant in ch 109 78 ng per g dw the main phytof found in all sources was ent 16 rs 13 epi st δ14 9 phytof at 196 56 126 22 and 207 57 ng per g dw in cp ch and cph respectively we provide the first complete profile of phytops and phytofs for these agro residues which could be  in the functional food industry for enriching food or as nutritional supplements    dès les années 80 grâce à l émergence d outils empruntés à la biologie1 les

pas documentés par les sources écrites antérieures au xiiie siècle en corolaire au développement des stratégies d échantillonnage    the effects of extra virgin olive oil evoo and carbon tetrachloride ccl 4 induced oxidative stress in rats were determined by the generation of isoprostanoids these are known to be robust biomarkers to evaluate nnzymatic and free radical related oxidation other oxidative stress biomarkers such as hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid products hetes and cholesterol oxidation products cops were also determined the rodents received a control diet high fat diet 20 w w composed of extra virgin olive oil evoo corn oil co or lard and high fat diets with ccl 4 insult throughout the experimental period the evoo diet was found to suppress the formation of isoprostanoids and cops compared to that of the control evoo also had a high total phenolic content and antioxidant activity compared to those of co and lard and may be contributed to by the hydroxytyrosol compnt conjugated to fatty acids ht fa this is the first study to identify ht fa in evoo and it was 4 fold higher than that of olive oil whereas n was found in corn oil furthermore the evoo diet showed reduced liver lipid vesicles in ccl 4 treated rats compared to that of the control however liver toxicity measurements of ast aspartate transaminase and alt alanine transaminase activities showed augmentation with ccl 4 treatment but were not alleviated by the diets given our findings suggest that evoo is a daily functional food capable of enhancing the antioxidant system for liver protection the effect is potentially attributed to the phenolic and lipophenolic phenol conjugated by fatty acids content    the aim of the this study was to determine the effect of a polyphenols rich juice aronia citrus juice acj on f 4 neuroprostanes and f 2 dihomo isoprostanes markers of oxidative stress associated with the central nervous system cns in 16 elite triathletes under a controlled diet for triathlon training 145 days in the triathletes a decrease of the lipid peroxidation markers after acj intake associated with neuronal membrane degradation 10 epi 10 f 4t neuroprostane and 10 f 4t neuroprostane was observed when compared with placebo stage values regarding the f 2 dihomo isoprostanes a significant decrease of the neuromotor system damage biomarkers 17 f 2t dihomo isoprostane with an increase of training load during the study was observed although the decrease of the load training at the last stage showed a significant increase of the values of ent 7 rs 7 f 2t dihomo isop suggesting a possible role in adaptation post training on the other hand the changes in the excretion of 17 epi 17 f 2t dihomo isop provided a positive connection between physical exercise and acj intake thus the results showed in this clinical study in young triathletes will help to elucidate novel interactions and mechanisms between the excretion of lipid peroxidation metabolites from cns supplementation of polyphenols rich juice in the diet and physical exercise during a training season    adrenic acid ada and docosahexaenoic acid dha peroxidation produces f 2 dihomo isops and neuro prostanes which have been related to oxidative damage in the central nervous system besides poly phenols melatonin mel and hydroxytyrosol ohtyr could be partly responsible for the antioxidant benefits of red wine excluding colon derivatives in order to elucidate whether these compounds are responsible for the protective antioxidant effects of red wine a double blind crossover placebo controlled in vivo study involving the intake of red wines and their native musts by healthy volunteers was performed the urinary metabolites decreased after the administration of red wines to a greater extent than after the intake of their corresponding musts or ethanol melatonin is the most effective compound that protects adrenic acid from oxidative attack judged by the reduction in the formation of f 2 dihomo isoprostanes similarly hydroxytyrosol being the most effective bioactive compound in reducing the formation of f 3 neuroprostanes n 6 dpa and f 4 neuroprostanes protected docosahexaenoic and eicosapentaenoic acids from oxidative attack    oxylipins are lipid mediators involved in the physiopathology of all organs moreover isoprostanes have been established as general and reliable in vivo oxidative stress biomarkers red wine has proved to exert several benefits through the maintenance of the oxidative balance of the organism antiradical scavenging capacity has been mainly attributed to polyphenols however melatonin and hydroxytyrosol should be taken into account as potent antiradical agents the present research aimed to clarify the situation of enzymatic and oxidative injury and eicosanoid urinary excretion related to the intake of three kinds of red wines and their primary musts judging by the reduction in the excretion of isoprostanes red wine consumption exhibited the highest antioxidant protection against oxidative stress attributed to its ohtyr content p 0 05 and to a lesser extent to its mel content similarly the intake of red wine leads to the cardioprotective effect due to the reduction in the urinary excretion of the pro inflammatory prostaglan din 2 3 dinor 11 β pgf 2α besides the increase in the vasodilator prostaglandin pge 1 mediated by the melatonin p 0 05 and hydroxytyrosol p 0 05 contents in conclusion red wine especially non aged wine exerts a higher in vivo antioxidant capacity than must or alcohol    we analyzed biomarkers of lipid peroxidation of the nervous system f 2 dihomo isoprostanes f 3 neuropros tanes and f 4 neuroprostanes in urine samples from 158 healthy volunteers ranging from 4 to 88 years old with the aim of analyzing possible associations between their excretion values and age years ten biomarkers were screened in the urine samples by uhplc qqq ms ms four f 2 dihomo isoprostanes ent 7 r 7 f 2t dihomo

found a significant positive correlation rho 0 197 p 0 015 between the age increase and the amount of total f 2 dihomo isops on the other hand the values were significantly higher in the childhood group 4 12 years old when compared to the adolescence group 13 17 years old and the young adult group 18 35 years old surprisingly no significant differences were found between the middle aged adults 36 64 years old and the elderly adults 65 88 years old we display a snapshot situation of excretory values of oxidative stress biomarkers of the nervous system  healthy volunteers representative of the different stages of human growth and development the values reported in this study could be  as a basal or starting point in clinical interventions related to aging processes and or pathologies associated with the nervous system    tracking enzyme localization and following the local biochemical modification of the substrate should help explain the recalcitrance of lignocellulosic plant cell walls to enzymatic degradation time lapse studies  conventional imaging require enzyme labeling and following the biochemical modifications of biopolymers found in plant cell walls which cannot be easily achieved in the present work synchrotron facilities have been  to image the enzymatic degradation of lignocellulosic biomass without labeling the enzyme or the cell walls multichannel autofluorescence imaging of the protein and phenolic compounds after excitation at 275 nm highlighted the presence or absence of enzymes on cell walls and made it possible to track them during the reaction image analysis was  to quantify the fluorescence intensity variations consistent variations in the enzyme concentration were found locally for cell cavities and their surrounding cell walls microfluidic ft ir microspectroscopy allowed for time lapse tracking of local changes in the polysaccharides in cell walls during degradation hemicellulose degradation was found to occur prior to cellulose degradation  a celluclast r preparation combining the fluorescence and ft ir information yielded the conclusion that enzymes did not bind to lignified cell walls which were consequently not degraded fluorescence multiscale imaging and ft ir microspectroscopy showed an unexpected variability both in the initial biochemical composition and the degradation pattern highlighting micro domains in the cell wall of a given cell fluorescence intensity quantification showed that the enzymes were not evenly distributed and their amount increased progressively on degradable cell walls during degradation adjacent cells were separated and the cell wall fragmented until complete degradation    hydrophobically modified chitooligosaccharides coss were tested for suitability as an emulsifier in cationic bituminous emulsions coss with polymerization degrees dps of 5 10 15 and 20 were obtained by nitrous acid deamination a complete study on depolymerization and precise product and side product characterization was underg chemical modification of coss was performed to achieve amphiphilic structures  three fatty epoxides with a growing chain length butyl c4 octadecyl c9 and hexadecyl glycidyl ether c16 the grafting efficiency according to reaction conditions was established different substitution degrees dss were obtained by modulating the ratio of fatty epoxy to nh2 it was shown that after a certain ds the oligomers thus formed were not water soluble anymore at the end cardanol glycidyl ether was grafted on dp 5 10 and 15 coss cardanol being a biobased compound extracted from cashew nut shell this reaction led to a potentially fully biobased structure water soluble candidates with a higher ds were  as surfactants to emulsify motor oil as a simulation of bitumen cardanol chitosan based surfactants led to direct oil in water emulsion 60 40 w w composed of particles of 15 μm average size that were stable at least for 24 h    alzheimer disease ad standard biological diagnosis is based on expensive or invasive procedures recent research has foc on some molecular mechanisms involved since early ad stages such as lipid peroxidation therefore a non invasive screening approach based on new lipid peroxidation compounds determination would be very useful well defined early ad patients and healthy participants were recruited lipid peroxidation compounds were determined in urine  a validated analytical method based on liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry statistical studies consisted of the evaluation of  different linear elastic net and non linear random forest regression models to discriminate between groups of participants the regression models fitted to the data from some lipid peroxidation biomarkers isoprostanes neuroprostanes prostaglandines dihomo isoprostanes in urine as potential predictors of early ad these prediction models achieved fair validated area under the receiver operating characteristics auc rocs 0 68 and their results corroborated each other since they are based on different analytical principles a satisfactory early screening approach   complementary regression models has been obtained from urine levels of some lipid peroxidation compounds indicating the individual probability of suffering from early ad    α linolenic acid ala and its non enzymatic oxidized products namely phytoprostanes and phytofurans are found in some nuts the uptake and deposition of these compounds are not well defined walnut has high ala and a considerable amount of phytoprostanes and phytofurans compared to other common nuts when fed to rodents ala and eicosapentaenoic acid levels increased in the liver and heart tissues compared to the control diet furthermore phytoprostanes and phytofurans were elevated 3fold in both tissues after a walnut diet indicating that they are not only contributed from the diet but also generated through in vivo autoxidation of ala found in the walnuts it was further noted that a walnut diet reduced 5 f 2t isoprostanes and 12hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and induced 4 f 4t neuroprostane and significant amounts of anti inflammatory hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid in the liver only altogether high ala in a walnut diet elevated phytoprostanes and phytofurans in the liver and heart tissues and showed the regulation of anti inflammatory lipid mediators in the liver only    cocoa has been widely discussed as a bioactive food rich in sensory stimulation and health benefits however no information has been provided concerning phytoprostanes phytops and phytofurans phytofs in cocoa these compounds are of interest because they play a role in the regulation of immune function the present study included 31 cocoa cls the phytops and phytofs were quantified by uhplc qqq ms ms the total phytops and phytofs contents ranged from 221 46 to 1589 83 ng g 1 and from 1 18 to 13 13 ng g 1 respectively the profiles of the phytops and phytofs identified in the cocoa beans showed significant differences among the cls analysed the results indicate that dry fermented cocoa beans are rich in phytops and phytofs which may represent an additional benefit of the consumption of foods derived from cocoa    lipid peroxidation is closely related to neurodegenerative diseases since brain shows high lipid composition and oxygen consumption the determination of lipid peroxidation compounds in non invasive biological samples would help to monitor the patients oxidative stress status a new analytical method based on ultrasound assisted liquid liquid semi microextraction ua llsme followed by ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry was developed to determine 18 lipid peroxidation biomarkers in saliva samples the variables affecting the ua llsme efficiency were systematically studied under the optimum conditions the methodology was validated and showed high throughput high sensitivity limits of detection 0 02 2 nmol l 1 and satisfactory precision coef ficients of variation 2 11 intra day and 5 12 inter day the reliability of the described method was assessed analysing spiked saliva samples and the recoveries were between 80 and 120 for most of the analytes then the method suitability was demonstrated by analysing saliva samples n 30 from elderly people with neurodegenerative diseases to conclude the new developed analytical method is a useful tool to determine salivary lipid peroxidation compounds as potential biomarkers in further clinical studies in which oxidative stress plays an important role    today internet technology proposes communication exchange and data storage powerful tools they are standardized and accessible to the companies but usually they are not adapted for a mechanical design use and they do not take into account the design process so in this context we present a method allowing the definition of real needs for collaborative engineering in terms of creation management and exchange of technical data and more specially geometrical data from the results of this analysis we propose a model on which is based a geometrical modelling methodology for mechanical products in a integrated design and collaborative engineering context    a product design goes through a digital mock up which is based on the product geometric model this latter has an important role in the design project whose exploitation mainly depends on how it has been established 1 furthermore the growing competitive context hardly encourages firms to implement new working methods like collaborative engineering however its implementation in combination with product geometric data generates many problems in terms of project and data management for this purpose this article proposes a methodological solution to the problem at hand moreover the problem gets complicated as the project progresses as a result the detailed design phase becomes critical particularly in the face of this problem therefore the current article focuses on this phase of the product design process through an example      the european directive 2006 42 ce promulgates the machine safe design principles to prevent professional risks however outside machines that have specific safety standards the designers of special machines and manufacturing systems can only use generic safety standards limiting as a consequence the results of hazards detection the aim of this  is to present an original approach for this detection during the design of working equipment we based our study on a hypothesis of the literature that links hazards to the presence of energy flows thus the hazards detection is reduced to the study of the building of energy flows and the detection of potential links between these flows and the operator thanks to such data the designer will be able to select the best risk prevention solutions to reach this goal we decided to use the functional energetic model femo to model the technical system and its energy flows this choice was made because this model was developed for the design of technical systems integrating different types of energy by  this modelling the designer can easily analyses every potential interactions between the energy flows and the operator depending on the future working situations in each life cycle phases our approach builds on this model all along the design process allowing the designer to early detect hazards and to apply at the best moment the risk prevention solutions we present the application of this approach during the design of a working equipment since the definition of the raw need we confirm that its application and the system modelling in the efm formalism are possible since the conceptual design phase data from the next design phases enrich the model and consequently improve the detection and characterization of hazards     this  is dedicated to integrated safety which is dealing to apply as soon as possible safe machine design principle more human in the factory is  of the main themes of the factory of the future paradigm despite of current researches on design methodologies and standards practical uses of this approach are not yet perfect in order to answer to these objectives inrs and ensam have signed a research agreement in order to gives to the machine or manufacturing systems designers structured methods models tools and so to help them during the design process this  present studies carrying out results obtained following the axis working equipment requirements preliminary design of manufacturing equipment taking account of health and safety    human in the factory is  of the main themes of the factory of the future in this context the aim of this  is to present the new issues for workers safety and the in tegrated design concepts or methodologies which have to be taking into account new paradigms come into being the uncertainty of the demand in terms of products as well as production rate product customization integration product service the man ufacturing processes are not fixed so the manufacturing times cannot be foreseen re configuration of machine tools as manufacturing systems space organization auto organization planning new technologies are implemented robots plug and play devices virtual augmented reality sensors opc standards connected objects several tasks are performed by the workers the robots or in collaboration the work ers are place in the center of the factory of the future but this concept introduce haz ard events problems of health and safety physical or cognitive tasks fatigue stress space or time organization interfaces human robot to take into account of the dif ferent life situations so the aim of the  is to present studies carrying out in order to propose to the machine or manufacturing systems designers as well as pro duction managers structured methods models tools in order to get safe working sit uations in the frame of the factory of the future paradigm    as an industrial point of view product design activity answer to firmsdevelopment needs this activity requires a lot of heterogeneous knowledge and skills whichhave to converge towards a common goal describe a product meeting the market needs consequently there are many interactions between the firm its market and the design activity therefore a development project must take into account specifications and constraints of eachelement the goal of this phd is to define a generic methodological framework allowing to builtand control a product design project depending on the firm development goals and its ownresources for this it is important to include many technical factors such innovation multitechnologicalproducts and numerical data specificities but also economical and financialfactors as the difficult competitive environment or limited financial resources all theseheterogeneous parameters involve a global approach of the problem that is why a  stageresearch approach is applied to build this framework in the first stage a conceptual diagram isdesigned  items coming from the company goals its market and design activity interactions and behavior of all these items are deduced from this conceptual diagram theseresults are formalized through a generic process this last  is finally applied to severalexamples from sme working in the mechanical field    reactivation of latent m tuberculosis mtb infection is a major complication of anti tnfalpha treatment but its mechanism is not fully understood in this work we evaluated in  conditions the effect of the tnf antagonists infliximab adalimumab and etanercept on anti mycobacterial immune responses with ex vivo studies from patients treated with tnf antagonists and with the in vitro addition of tnf antagonists to cells stimulated with mycobacteria antigens in both cases we analysed the response of cd4 t lymphocytes to ppd and to cfp 10 an antigen restricted to mtb the tests performed were lymphoproliferation and immediate production of ifngamma elispot in the 68 patients with inflammatory diseases rheumatoid arthritis spondylarthropathy or crohn s disease including 31 patients with a previous or latent tuberculosis tb fourteen weeks of anti tnfalpha treatment had no effect on the proliferation of cd4 t lymphocytes in contrast the number of ifngamma releasing cd4 t lymphocytes decreased for ppd p 0 005 and cfp 10 p 0 01 in patients with previous tb and for ppd p 0 05 in other patients all vaccinated with bacille calmette guerin treatments with infliximab and with etanercept affected ifngamma release to a similar extent in vitro addition of tnf antagonists to cd4 t lymphocytes stimulated with mycobacteria antigens inhibited their proliferation and their expression of membrane bound tnf mtnf these effects occurred late in cultures suggesting a direct effect of tnf antagonists on activated mtnf cd4 t lymphocytes infliximab and adalimumab were more efficient than etanercept for these in vitro effects therefore tnf antagonists have a dual action on anti mycobacteria cd4 t lymphocytes administered in vivo they decrease the frequency of the subpopulation of anti mycobacteria memory cd4 t lymphocytes rapidly releasing ifngamma upon challenge with mycobacteria antigens all tnf antagonists are as efficient to induce this decline added in vitro they inhibit the activation of cd4 t lymphocytes by mycobacteria antigens with a stronger effect of infliximab and adalimumab than of etanercept such a dual effect may explain the increased incidence of tb in patients treated with tnf antagonists as well as possible differences between tnf antagonists for the incidence and the clinical presentation of tb reactivation    additive manufacturing am became an advanced research topic due to its ability to manufacture complex shapes but the ability to achieve predictable and repeatable shapes is critical therefore to optimize the design of an additive manufactured product tolerancing is a key issue this  focuses on geometrical quality assessment of an am product it includes a process oriented geometrical model to predict the surface roughness and dimensional deviations and a geometrical simulation tool to assess the impacts of these deviations on the geometrical behaviour of the joint an application of the approach is illustrated through a case study    in tolerancing analysis area the most various existing approaches do not take form defects of parts into consideration as high precisions assemblies cannot be analyzed with the assumption that form defects are negligible the  focuses in particular on the study of the form defects impacts on the assembly simulation and that by comparing  optimization algorithms ihlrf and quapro the study is limited firstly to the cylinders for the optimization  main types of surfaces modelling are considered difference surface based method and real model the compared models allow assessing the non interferences between cylinders with form defects potentially in contact this is in the main issue to validate a tolerance analysis approach    in many modern manufacturing industries data that characterize the manufacturing process are electronically collected and stored in the databases due to advances in data collection systems and analysis tools data mining dm has widely been applied for quality assessment qa in manufacturing industries in dm the choice of technique to use in analyzing a dataset and assessing the quality depend on the understanding of the analyst on the other hand with the advent of improved and efficient prediction techniques there is a need for an analyst to know which tool performs best for a particular type of data set although a few review s have recently been published to discuss dm applications in manufacturing for qa this  provides an extensive review to investigate the application of a special dm technique namely support vector machine svm to solve qa problems the review provides a comprehensive analysis of the literature from various points of view as dm preliminaries data preprocessing dm applications for each quality task svm preliminaries and application results  tables and figures are also provided besides to the analyses finally conclusions and future research directions are provided   abstract tolerance analysis aims on checking whether specified tolerances enable functional and assembly requirements the tolerance analysis approaches discussed in literature are generally assumed without the consideration of parts form defects this  presents a new model to consider the form defects in an assembly simulation a metric modal decomposition mmd method is henceforth developed to model the form defects of various parts in a mechanism the assemblies including form defects are further assessed  mathematical optimization the optimization involves  models of surfaces real model and difference surface base method and introduces the concept of signed distance the optimization algorithms are then compared in terms of time consumption and accuracy to illustrate the methods and their respective applications a simplified over constrained industrial mechanism in three dimensions is also  as a case study    reconfigurable manufacturing systems constitute a new manufacturing paradigm and are considered as the future of manufacturing because of their changeable and flexible nature in a reconfigurable manufacturing environment basic modules can be rearranged interchanged or modified to adjust the production capacity according to production requirements reconfigurable machine tools have modular structure comprising of basic and auxiliary modules that aid in modifying the functionality of a manufacturing system as the product s design and its manufacturing capabilities are closely related the manufacturing system is desired to be customizable to cater for all the design changes moreover the performance of a manufacturing system lies in a set of planning and scheduling data incorporated with the machining capabilities keeping in view the market demands this research work is based on the co evolution of process planning and machine configurations in which optimal machine capabilities are generated through the application of multi objective genetic algorithms furthermore based on these capabilities the system is tested for reconfiguration in case of production changeovers since in a reconfigurable environment the same machine can be  to perform different tasks depending on the required configuration the subject research work assigns optimum number of machines by minimizing the machining capabilities to carry out different operations in order to streamline production responses an algorithm has also been developed and verified on a part family as a result of the  methodology an optimized reconfigurable framework can be achieved to realize optimal production of a part family finally the  methodology was applied on a case study and respective conclusions were drawn    to determine the relative position of any  surfaces in a system  approach is to use operations minkowski sum and intersection on sets of constraints these constraints are made compliant with half spaces of r n where each set of half spaces defines an operand polyhedron these operands are generally unbounded due to the inclusion of degrees of invariance for surfaces and degrees of freedom for joints defining theoretically unlimited displacements to solve operations on operands minkowski sums in particular cap halfspaces are added to each polyhedron to make it compliant with a polytope which is by definition a bounded polyhedron the difficulty of this method lies in controlling the influence of these additional half spaces on the topology of polytopes calculated by sum or intersection this is necessary to validate the geometric tolerances that ensure the compliance of a mechanical system in terms of functional requirements    the statistical tolerance analysis has become a key element used in the design stage to reduce the manufacturing cost the rejection rate and to have high quality products  of the frequently used methods is the monte carlo simulation employed to compute the non conformity rate due to its efficiency in handling the tolerance analysis of over constrained mechanical systems however this simulation technique requires excessive numerical efforts the goal of this  is to improve this method by proposing a probabilistic model of gaps in fixed and sliding contacts and involved in the tolerance analysis of an assembly the probabilistic model is carried out on the clearance compnts of the sliding and fixed contacts for their assembly feasibility considering all the imperfections on the surfaces the kernel density estimation method is used to deal with the probabilistic model the  method is applied to an over constrained mechanical system and compared to the classical method regarding their computation time    during the design stage of product manufacturing the designers try to specify only the necessary critical dimensions or what is called key characteristics knowing that dealing with key characteristics is time consuming and costly it is preferable to reduce their number and exclude the non contributing parameters different strategies that are based on qualitative or quantitative approaches for the identification of these dimensions are followed by the companies the common way is to define the critical functional requirements which are expressed in terms of dimensions when the functional requirements are set as critical all the involved dimensions are labelled as key characteristics however they do not have the same importance and need to be classified between contributing and non contributing parameters there is not a quantitative method that serves for the identification of key characteristics in the critical functional requirements this  suggests a numerical methodology which can be a step forward to a better ranking of the key characteristics it is based on the global sensitivity analysis and more precisely on sobol approach the sensitivity of the non conformity rate corresponding to the production of the product is measured with respect to the variable parameters characterizing the dimensions the method is applied first on a simple  part example then on a system having a linearised functional requirement and finally on a system with  non linear functional requirements the results show the main effects of the dimensions in addition to their interactions consequently it is possible to prioritize some and neglect the effect of the others and classify them respectively as key characteristics or not    in geometric tolerancing analysis area a classical approach consists in handling polyhedrons coming from sets of linear constraints the relative position between any  surfaces of a mechanism is determined by operations minkowski sum and intersection on these polyhedrons the polyhedrons are generally unbounded due to the inclusion of degrees of invariance for surfaces and degrees of freedom for joints defining theoretically unlimited displacements in a first part are introduced the cap half spaces to limit these displacements in order to transform the polyhedron into polytopes this method requires controlling the influence of these additional half spaces on the topology of calculated polytopes this is necessary to ensure the traceability of these half spaces through the tolerancing analysis process a second part provides an inventory of the issues related to the numerical implementation of polytopes  of them depends on the choice of a computation configuration expression point and base homogenization coefficients to define a polytope after proving that the modification of a computation configuration is an affine transformation several simulation strategies are listed in order to understand the problems of numerical precision and computation time    in tolerance analysis it is necessary to check that the cumulative defect limits specified for the compnt parts of a product are compliant with the functional requirements expected of the product defect limits can be modelled by tolerance zs constructed by offsets on nominal models of parts cumulative defect limits can be modelled  a calculated polytope the result of a set of intersections and minkowski sums of polytopes a functional requirement can be qualified by a functional polytope in other words a target polytope it is then necessary to verify whether the calculated polytope is included in the functional polytope the purpose of this article is to determine the minkowski sum of 3 dimension polytopes and apply this effectively in order to optimise the filling of the functional polytope this method can be used to determine from which vertices of the operands the vertices of the minkowski sum derive it is also possible to determine to which facets of the operands each facet of the minkowski sum is oriented first the main properties of the duality of normal cs and primal cs associated with the vertices of a polytope are described next the properties of normal fans are applied to define the vertices and facets of the minkowski sum of  polytopes an algorithm is proposed which generalises the method lastly there is a discussion of the features of this algorithm developed  the opencascade environment    this report presents the dynamic modeling of a planar biped robot the robot has seven bodies and 9 dof  kinematic configurations are investigated the first has only revolute joints on all articulation the second differs by the presence of rolling contact on the knees all matrices involved in the model are given in explicit form all the possibilities of contact between the feet and the ground are considered    the knee of biped robots has usually  degree of freedom which  is a revolute joint this work focuses on the study of rolling contact knee the knee is composed of a cylinder in the extremity of the femur rolling on another cylindrical surface which is the tibia studies have shown that this structure allows to reduce the torque during the gait energetic optimization series were made with this structure and for different cylinder radii the angular trajectories describing the gait are generated by cubic splines functions the gait is composed of single support phase followed by an impact the minimization of energetic criterion is realized  the simplex algorithm of nelder mead the results show that higher radii of the tibia permit to reduce energy consumption during the gait the study of new contact surfaces is a way to decrease the energy consumption    this  presents the energy consumption of a biped robot with a new modelled structure of knees which is called rolling knee rk the dynamic model the actuators and the friction coefficients of the gear box are known the optimal energy consumption can also be calculated the first part of the  is to validate the new kinematic knee on a biped robot by comparing the energy consumption during a walking step of the identical biped but with revolute joint knees the cyclic gait is given by a succession of single support phase ssp followed by an impact the gait trajectories are parameterized by cubic spline functions the energetic criterion is minimized through optimization while  the simplex algorithm and lagrange penalty functions to meet the constraints of stability and deflection of the mobile foot an analysis of the friction coefficients is d by simulation to compare the human characteristics to the robot with rk the simulation results show an energy consumption reduction through the biped with rolling knee configuration the influence of friction coefficients shows the energy consumption of biped robot is close to that of the human    the design of humanoid robots has been a tricky challenge for several years due to the kinematic complexity of human joints their movements are notoriously difficult to be reproduced by a mechanism the human knees allow movements including rolling and sliding and therefore the design of new bioinspired knees is of utmost importance for the reproduction of anthropomorphic walking in the sagittal plane in this article the kinematic characteristics of knees were analyzed and a mechanical solution for reproducing them is  the geometrical kinematic and dynamic models are built together with an impact model for a biped robot with the new knee kinematic the walking gait is studied as a problem of parametric optimization under constraints the trajectories of walking are approximated by mathematical functions for a gait composed of single support phases with impacts energy criteria allow comparing the robot provided with the new rolling knee mechanism and a robot equipped with revolute knee joints the results of the optimizations show that the rolling knee brings a decrease of the sthenic criterion the comparisons of torques are also observed to show the difference of energy distribution between the actuators for the same actuator selection these results prove that the robot with rolling knees can walk longer than the robot with revolute joint knees    in this article we focus on numerical algorithms for which in practice parallelism and accuracy do not cohabit well in order to increase parallelism expressions are reparsed implicitly  mathematical laws like associativity and this reduces the accuracy our approach consists in performing an exhaustive study we generate all the algorithms equivalent to the original  and compatible with our relaxed time constraint next we compute the worst errors which may arise during their evaluation for several relevant sets of data our main conclusion is that relaxing very slightly the time constraints by choosing algorithms whose critical paths are a bit longer than the optimal makes it possible to strongly optimize the accuracy we extend these results to the case of bounded parallelism and to accurate sum algorithms that use compensation techniques    the author presents an approach to study an innovative manufacturing process developed to produce composite parts

process by an experimental analysis and fem simulations with forge3 the reliability of the simulation tool ans its potential never exploited in this area will be evaluated    forging in semi solid

deployment in this context an alternative route is  in the  process semi solid zs at the heart of the material coexist with surrounding solid zs within the part the outcome is an optimized process where the benefits of thixoforging are reached at a significant extent within the classical process framework of hot forging the  investigates this proposal up to a full scale proof of concept in an industrial setting    based on several years of research this  presents some approaches on industrializing steel thixoforging processes from a billet to a complex shaped final part obtained in  single

order to provide tools to industrials to select and qualify a machine for their fsw applications this  presents a methodology to determine the friction stir welding equipment adequate to an application the adequate equipment can be every machine that can perform friction stir welds this  presents a short review based on literature survey of the existing friction stir welding equipments then the methodology developed is presented it is based on the studying of the interactions between the tool and the workpiece    till now the definition of cross wedge rolling dies requires know how and important expertise from the designers a decision making methodology is being developed to provide sequential and logical steps to draw easier and faster the tool geometry this methodology is based on designing rules found in literature that link the geometrical parameters of the desired rolled part and the geometrical parameters of the tool nevertheless in the literature the rules are not always consistent because the admissible domain for a parameter can differ from  author to another in order to take into account this variability a stability index is associated to each rule and to the designed tool the methodology allows updating of the existing rules and the implementation of new rules the set of parameters defining the geometry of the tool can be exported in the cad cam software and fem software a case study is presented to illustrate and validate the methodology    although the role of the complement system in cancer development has been studied its involvement in the development of an antitumoral immune response remains poorly understood  cobra venom factor cvf to inhibit the complement cascade via c3 molecule exhaustion in immunocompetent mice bearing b16gp33 melanoma tumors we show that transient inhibition of the complement system allowed for the development of a more robust gp33 specific antitumoral cd8 þ t cell response this immune response proved to be natural killer nk dependent suggesting an interaction of complement proteins with this cellular subset leading to t lymphocyte activation and enhanced cytotoxic t cell activity against tumor cells this study demonstrates for the first time the implication of the complement system in the development of nk mediated cytotoxic t cell dependent antitumoral immune responses the complement pathway could therefore be a potent therapeutic target to improve nk dependent antitumoral immune responses in patients with cancer cancer immunol res 2 3 200 6 ó2013 aacr     the present  focuses the modelling and the simulation of a direct thixoextrusion test achieved on c38 semi solid steel to validate the modelling and the simulation it is important to get various experimental informations during the test and to correlate them with simulated results in a previous  becker et al 2008 the macro and micro structure obtained for different process parameters during thixoextrusion of c38 were investigated in this work those results are correlated to those obtained by simulations of the processing the constitutive equation of the material is given by a multi scale modelling based on micromechanics and homogenization techniques labelled as micro macro modelling favier et al 2009 the parameters of the model are determined i  literature results and ii to match various experimental measurements obtained during the test and described in becker et al 2008 such as the die temperature during the test and the load displacement curve comparisons between experimental and simulated reveal the presence of complex temperature field and the presence of zs having very low viscosities these zs contribute actively to the semi solid material flow    as a solution for traditional design process having many drawbacks in the manufacturing process the integration of product design process selection process planning is carried out in the early design phase the technological economic and logistic parameters are taken into account simultaneously as well as manufacturing constraints being integrated into the product design as a consequence the most feasible alternative with regard to the product s detailed design is extracted satisfying the product s functional requirements subsequently a couple of conceptual process plans are  relied on manufacturing processes being preliminarily selected in the conceptual design phase virtual manufacturing is employed under cam software to simulate fabrication process of the potential process plans ultimately the most suitable process plan for fabricating the part is recommended based upon a multi criteria analysis as a resolution for decision making       weld cladding is employed to improve the service life of engineering compnts by increasing corrosion and wear resistance and reducing the cost the acceptable multi bead cladding layer depends on single bead geometry hence in first step the relationship between input process parameters and the single bead geometry is studied and in second step a comprehensive study on multi bead clad layer deposition is carried out this  highlights an experimental study carried out to get single layer cladding deposited by automated gmaw process and to find the possibility of hot forming of the cladded work piece to get the final hot formed improved structure the experiments for single bead were conducted by varying the three main process parameters wire feed rate arc voltage and welding speed while keeping other parameters like nozzle to work distance shielding gas and its flow rate and torch angle constant the effect of bead spacing and torch orientation on the cladding quality of single layer from the results of single bead deposition was studied a hot bending test at different temperatures of cladded plates with different dilution and nominal energy carried out    during friction stir welding process fsw a tool workpiece mechanical interaction is generated leading to forces and torques applied on the tool these forces and torques are transmitted to the welding equipment impacting its technical requirements this  presents a forces and torques analysis according to the processing parameters on the welding at constant speed stage the analysis was performed on the whole welding process windows by varying  process parameter after the other the goal of this work is to determine if and how the forces and torque could be reduced by working on the processing parameters so with lower forces and torque applied on the tool the use of a standard and flexible welding equipment allowing the welding of complex geometries could be enabled    steel thixoforging is an innovative semi solid forming process it allows the manufacturing of complex parts and minimises the forming load this work aims to identify and characterise the main feature zs of a thixoforging part the material flow and the forging load are dependent on the thixoforging speed the tool temperature and the initial temperature of the slug the data are obtained for c38 thixoforging steel a specific extrusion tool was designed that integrates the heating of the tool and the slug this tool was set up on a high speed hydraulic press this work highlights the effects of heat exchange on the microstructure the internal flow and the mechanical characteristics of thixoforging material these heat exchanges depend primarily on the working speed and tool temperature the internal flow is composed of three distinct zs among them only semisolid z is observed during working the microstructures of thixoforming c38 steel consist of ferrite pearlite and bainite    not available    in the cross wedge rolling process cwr plastic deformation is geared by a driving torque transmitted by friction on die surface friction plays a role which has to be further identified in this metal forming process the local contact pressure between a cylindrical billet and flat dies seems to be a relevant parameter to characterize the severe contact conditions during the rolling this  deals with an experimental measurement technology which has been designed and implemented on a semi industrial cwr test bench with plate configuration this measurement system  pin and piezoelectric sensor is presented with an analysis of the system operation and design detail characterization of systematic error and calibration tests are then explained additional tests performed on hot steel preforms allow to check the ability of the contact pressure measurement system to resist under severe operating conditions realistic results for varying temperatures are then discussed    this  focuses on the hot forging of multi material cladded work pieces  upsetting tests thecase study corresponds to gas metal arc welding cladding of a ss316l on a mild steel c15 experimentaltests and simulations  a slab model and the finite element method were performed  differenttemperatures and die billet tribological conditions as a result a crack mode specific to clad billets wasobserved experimentally and can be predicted by the fe method  a latham and cockcroft criterion the material distribution was well simulated by the fe method in particular the effects of the frictionat die work piece interface on the crack occurrence the material distribution and to a lesser extent the forging load are well predicted however the latter was underestimated highlighting the fact thatthe effect of the dilution associated with the cladding process on the material behavior of the clad layercannot be neglected    the presented work is dedicated to studying the forgeability of bimaterial cladded billet hot upsetting tests of cylindrical low carbon steel c15 billets weld cladded mig by stainless steel ss316l are experimentally and numerically studied upsetting tests with different upsetting ratios are performed in different tribology conditions at 1050 c which is within the better forgeability temperature range of both substrate and cladding materials 1 slab model and finite element simulation are conducted to parametrically study the potential forgeability of the bimaterial cladded billet the viscoplastic law is adopted to model the friction at the die billet interface the friction condition at the die billet interface has a great impact on the final material distribution forging effort and cracking occurrence with latham and cockcroft criterion the possibility and potential position of cracks could be predicted    friction stir welding is known for his capability to achieve a linear weld however more investigation on a curved friction stir weld trajectory is still required to industrialize this promising process in the same perspective this study is aimed at analyzing the influence of nonlinear tool trajectory in friction stir welding the study considers a variety of circular trajectories on the plane plate and uses them for experimentation while considering different welding parameters of rotation speed feed speed axial force and tilt angle in fsw the tool is generally needed to be tilted with a constant angle in the travel direction during welding process therefore for circular trajectory an adequate roll and pitch angle are assigned to the spindle in all tool positions the  presents the effect of circular trajectory on longitudinal and transversal forces generated during circular welding the results are then compared with the experimental results which are obtained  linear fsw furthermore the experimental investigation includes relationship between tool trajectory and weld quality    the cross wedge rolling process is commonly  for the manufacturing of shaft or for preforms being  for preliminary operation of forming cycle the presence of angular deformation produced during the rolling process is analyzed in this  this work shows some experimental results obtained on parts made of steel in semi industrial condition visioplasticity technique is  to measure the angular displacement occurring in some sections with reference to the adjacent s thus the test samples are prepared to include surface grooves filled up with quite similar steel grade after rolling process angular deformations are highlighted by observations and external deformation profile influence of surface texture of the forming area is experimentally demonstrated moreover the numerical simulation with the software forge is  to verify the adequacy between the observed phenomena and forecasts which can be obtained today conclusions about the relative influence of friction factors on the internal stresses creation are finally presented to better identify potential occurrence of these phenomena strain diagrams are  to bring out the magnitude of angular variations depending on local plastic strain on parts possible consequences for process optimization are raised       since always industry minimizes manufacturing process plan and increases mechanical behaviour in this topic the thixoforging process offers important perspectives especially steel thixoforging it is on the way of industrial development between casting and forging process previous works have illustrated the importance many parameters such as steel grade slide speed slug and tool temperature on the geometry from thixoforging part and of the forming load this  completes the previous results it presents an analysis from mechanical resistance of samples extracted of from thixo extrusion parts on a high speed hydraulic press this strength investigation is correlated with metallurgical analysis macrograph analyses allow identifying the material yield during the process and the different phases    the development of ice slurry for refrigeration systems and the enhancement of its efficiency depend on an accurate control of the ice concentration we present here an ultrasonic method capable to measure precisely the particle concentration in ice slurry to calibrate the ultrasonic measurement we first determine the sound velocity and attenuation in  model suspensions glass beads polyethylene glycol and polyethylene beads vaseline oil for different particle volume fractions the experimental results show a good agreement with the predictions of the  compnt models in the long wavelength limit additionally the sound attenuation reveals a clear signature of the aggregate formation in the nearly iso dense suspension we next conduct the measurement of the sound velocity in the polypropylene glycol ice slurry where the ice concentration changes with temperature the ice concentrations extracted from our sound velocity measurements are well consistent with the values determined from the binary phase diagram    thixoforming of steels poses challenges due to the high temperatures involved and the lack of understanding of thermomechanical behavior the volume fractions of the liquid and solid phases in the semi solid state are the most important parameters for such a form ing process as they aﬀect the viscosity and hence the ﬂow behavior of the material  dimensional observations might not always be suﬃcient as the size distribution and the connectivity of phases cannot be obtained from associated measurements which can only be determined by three dimensional 3 d investigation this  presents the ﬁrst application of high energy x ray microtomography to the microstructure of steel in the semi solid state the microstructure of m2 high speed tool steel was studied in both as received and heated and quenched states from the reconstructed images 3 d information could be obtained and was compared with scanning elec tron microscopy and energy dispersive spectrometry observations the volume fraction and the location of liquid phase in the semi solid state were determined in particular and the continuous solid skeleton was investigated       steel thixoforging process combines the advantages of performing parts having highlycomplex shapes and good mechanical properties these advantages result from the shear thinning flow behaviour of semi solids due to microstructure changes during the material deformation many parameters such as steel grade raw speed slug temperature tool temperature influence the steel thixoforging process in this work we are interested in analysing the influence of thermal conditions as well as ram speed on the flow behaviour and the microstructure of the final parts to do so thixo extrusion tests on a high speed hydraulic press were performed on c38 steels  different ram speeds and different temperatures for the tools the temperature is measured in the die close to the tool material interface during the whole process correlations between the temperature measurements the flow profile and the microstructure are discussed  the finite element code forge2005 these thixo extrusion tests are simulated  an inverse method some parameters  in the thermal exchange modelling are identified by successive comparisons between calculated and measured temperatures within the die    since always industry minimizes manufacturing process plan and increases mechanical behaviour in this topic the thixoforging process offers important perspectives especially steel thixoforging it is on the way of industrial development between casting and forging process previous works have

cladding the macrostructure and microstructure of the interface and of the co based superalloy layers are studied the interface presents the form of wavelets with a period of 1000 µm and an amplitude of 250 µm the superalloy grains are deformed during the cladding process with several slip systems appearing near to the interface the superalloy grains elongate and tend to follow the geometry of the interface observation with a scanning electron microscope sem reveals zs of localised fusion at the interface the eds analysis shows that these fusion zs are the result of mixing between the base and cladding plates radiocrystallographic analysis by x ray diffraction reveals the presence of the f c c cobalt in the cobalt based superalloy layer thus cobalt retains its crystallographic structure f c c after cladding process hardness is evaluated with reference to microstructure near the interface the hardness of the superalloy is of the order of 600 hv1 kg in the remainder of the thickness hardness is of the order of 500 hv1 kg being greater than that of the unplated superalloy 270 hv1 kg the track obtained by an indentation test at the interface under a load of 100 kg exhibits no

processed in the semi solid state taking advantage of the thixotropic behavior of alloys in the semi solid state significant progress has been made in semi solid processing however the consequences of such behavior on the flow during thixoforming are still not completely understood to explore and better understand the influence of the different parameters on material flow during thixoextrusion process thixoextrusion experiments were performed  the low carbon steel c38 the billet was partially melted at high solid fraction effects of various process parameters including the initial billet temperature the temperature of die the punch speed during process and the presence of a ceraspray layer at the interface of tool and billet were investigated through experiments and simulation after analyzing the results thus obtained it was identified that the aforementid parameters mainly affect thermal exchanges between die and part the ceraspray layer not only plays a lubricant role but also acts as a thermal barrier at the interface of tool and billet furthermore the thermal effects can affect the material flow which is composed of various distinct zs    the distribution of liquid at the

solid state which is affected by the change in morphologies of microstructure at high temperature thixoextrusion tests with different combinations of forming temperature and forming speed were performed it was identified that several process parameters such as initial billet and die temperatures or forming speed affect thermal exchanges thereby influencing the microstructure evolution and material flow furthermore 2d and 3d microstructure characterization was performed on the same sample which was partial remelted and quenched reconstructed 3d images were compared with the s obtained

insecurity this nerk is completed in the eleventh century by comtales or vicomtales foundations usually linked to powerful castra the following century saw the development of cistercian monasteries but all small monastic establishments disappear absorbed by the powerful abbeys to become priories their demise seems linked to their poverty to the political instability and to the lack of vocations but also to the spiritual and material attraction of their powerful neighbors abbeys of lagrasse alet and fontfroide    a series of samples based on poly 3 hydroxybutyrate phb containing five

of its applications is in the manufacturing process of connecting rods cwr transforms a cylindrical billet into a complex axisymmetrical shape with an accurate distribution of material this preform is forged into shape in a forging die in order to improve cwr tool lifecycle and product quality it is essential to understand tool wear evolution and the physical phenomena that change on the cwr process due to the resulting geometry of the tool when undergoing tool wear in order to understand cwr tool wear behavior numerical simulations are necessary nevertheless if the simulations are

thixotropic behaviour of semi solids however the consequences of such behaviour on the flow during thixoforming is still neither completely characterized and nor fully understood especially for high melting point alloys the study described in this  investigates thixoextrusion for c38 low carbon steel material  dies at temperatures much lower than the slug temperature four different process parameters were studied the initial slug temperature the die temperature the ram speed and the presence of a ceramic layer at the tool material interface the extruded parts were found to have an exact shape and a good surface state only if the temperature was below a certain value this critical temperature is not an intrinsic material property since its value depends on die temperature and the presence of the ceraspray layer  kinds of flow were highlighted a homogeneous flow controlled by the behaviour of the solid skeleton characterized by a positive strain rate sensitivity and a non homogeneous flow macro liquid solid phase separation dominated by the flow of the free liquid with decreasing ram speed heat losses increase so that the overall consistency of the material improves leading to apparent negative strain rate sensitivity finally some ways to optimise thixoforming are proposed     background despite social inequalities in overweight obesity prevalence evidence based

the leg alignment gonometry is quantified by means of frontal x rays analysis allowing for surgical planning previously published studies show that this analysis restricted to the frontal plane is far from being the optimum  the present study is based on an existing technique three dimensional reconstruction of the knee from stereoradiography in order to tranfer this new technique in routine clinical practice we defined and evaluated a series of measurement and analysis tools allowing for a three dimensional quantification of the evolution of the leg alignment alterations pre per and post

correlation making both approaches very efficient for the study of the liquid zs in the semi solid state    the microstructure plays a crucial role for steel semi solid forming process and particularly for the steel thixoforging process since it determines the thixotropic flow behavior of materials in the semi solid state therefore it is necessary to well understand the microstructure evolution during high speed heating and forming classically it is investigated on a solid material quenched from semi solid state by 2d characterization techniques however the semi solid microstructure could probably not be preserved in the solid state by quenching due to complicated phase transformations or high diffusion rate of alloying elements during cooling especially at low liquid fractions in order to avoid this a new in situ technique high temperature confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm was developed and  for studying the microstructure evolution directly at high temperature the present study aims at providing an experimental investigation of the microstructure evolution on several steel grades m2 100cr6 and c38ltt during heating from the as received state to the semi solid state heating rate 200 c min and finally cooled to the solid state cooling rate 200 c min it has been found that the temperature sensitivity of liquid fraction δt δfl of these grades is much different in addition during cooling there is a significant difference in diffusion rate of alloying elements between these grades in m2 thanks to the high content of alloying elements and their low diffusion rate the semi solid temperature range is greater and its microstructure in the semi solid state could be preserved by quenching process or even at a low cooling rate on the contrary the microstructure of other steel grades 100cr6 and c38ltt in semi solid state can only be revealed by clsm at high temperature because of the lower volume fraction of alloying elements and their high diffusion rate it is very interesting to use high temperature clsm to in situ investigate the microstructure evolution in the semi solid state especially at low liquid fraction since the microstructure of m2 in the semi solid state can be reserved after cooling it is possible to identify liquid area by the post mortem examination therefore the material flow behavior of thixoforged parts could be investigated    lactase lct deficiency affects approximately 75 of the world s adult population and may lead to lactose malabsorption and intolerance currently the regulation of lct gene expression remains poorly known peroxisome proliferator activator receptorγ pparγ is a key player in carbohydrate metabolism while the intestine is essential for carbohydrate digestion and absorption the role of pparγ in enterocyte metabolic functions has been poorly investigated this study aims at characterizing pparγ target genes involved in intestinal metabolic functions in microarray analysis the lct gene was the most upregulated by pparγ agonists in caco 2 cells we confirmed that pparγ agonists were able to increase the expression and activity of lct both in vitro and in vivo in the proximal small bowel of rodents the functional response element activated by pparγ was identified in the promoter of the human lct gene pparγ modulation was able to improve symptoms induced by lactose enriched diet in weaned rats our results demonstrate that pparγ regulates lct expression and suggest that modulating intestinal pparγ activity might constitute a new therapeutic

subjectively by human eye between faces in graphic works  different pictorial techniques we submit images that are presumed to be portraits of leonardo da vinci for identification by facial recognition software algorithmic identification allowed us to compare each portrait to the whole database pair by pair however our experimental method led us to reverse our approach in the end we had to authenticate the results from facial recognition technology   to  visual comparison so that we double checked by submitting the portraits to a panel of nxpert volunteers thus verifying our hypothesis we proved that artificial intelligence is an invaluable addition to the toolkit of today s art expert reinforced by the natural abilities of the human eye it will be essential to recognizing and verifying the identity of subjects in works of art    in this  we present a support that helps organizing distributed design of products belonging to a product family we model the product to be developed as a compnt based tree of object templates develop a logic based language that allows expressing diverse development constraints and use these constraints to guide the design process the main objective of our support is to save time and development effort in increasing parallel work and avoiding roll backs for that it reasons in terms of correctness of the future final state of the product and verifies that the product state after each operation allows the reacheability of such a state      this  extends the results of a recently developed  dimensional model aiming to describe the characteristics of a magnetized chlorine high density plasma in this work the dependence of the plasma characteristics on the magnetic field intensity is investigated it is shown that the dissociation degree and the relative weight of the various charged species is strongly influenced by the magnetic field when the gas pressure is low enough in contrast at higher pressure the plasma is essentially composed of negative ions and molecular neutrals and ions independently of the field intensity it is further demonstrated that diffusion needs to be considered in order to correctly predict the plasma behavior    based on the idea that multidimensional data is better summarized as a shell rather than a cloud we have developed a surveillance approach that can detect with high sensitivity behaviour changes in a monitored process and alert the operator our methodology uses the time series of a high number of monitored indicators which we cluster together dynamically as a function of operating conditions these clusters represent groups of similar realizations  to characterize a multidimensional manifold that can be interpolated to assess each new realization of the process behaviour we evaluated the methodology on the data from a hydroelectric turbine the event of interest was the loss of the turbine propeller runner c the results are good and the approach is able to detect the abnormal behaviour months before the event happened we are currently looking at larger scale deployment to benchmark the approach s performance    a new vision in multidimensional statistics is  impacting several areas of application in these applications a set of noisy measurements characterizing the repeatable response of a process is known as a realization and can be seen as a single point in the projections of this point on the n axes correspond to the n measurements the contemporary vision of a diffuse cloud of realizations distributed in is replaced by a cloud in the shape of a shell surrounding a topological manifold this manifold corresponds to the process s stabilized response domain observed without the measurement noise the measurement noise which accumulates over several dimensions distances each realization from the manifold the probability density function pdf of the realization to manifold distance creates the shell considering the central limit theorem as the number of dimensions increases the pdf tends toward the normal distribution n 2 where fixes the center shell location and fixes the shell thickness in vision the likelihood of a realization is a function of the realization to shell distance rather than the realization to manifold distance the demonstration begins with the work of claude shannon followed by the introduction of the shell manifold and ends with practical applications to monitoring equipment   abstract this  proposes a non linear observer to estimate not only the state position and velocity of links but also the external forces exerted by the robot during friction stir welding fsw processes the difficulty of performing this process with a robot lies in its lack of rigidity in order to ensure a better tracking performance the data such as real positions velocities of links and external forces are required however those variations are not always measured in most industrial robots therefore in this study an observer is  to reconstruct those necessary parameters by  only measurements of motor side the  observer is carried out on a 6 dof flexible joint industrial manipulator  in a fsw process

functions the maximization of the likelihood function was achieved by  a stochastic optimization technique the simulated annealing sa the  algorithm was superior to the existing methods in terms of estimation accuracy and robustness in the presence of low signal to noise ratio snr motivated by its efficiency and optimality in the monocompnt case this  is an extension for multicompnt signals the

technique monte carlo simulations are presented and compared to the appropriate cramer rao bounds crb this proves the efficiency and the performance of the algorithm moreover it underscores the superiority on previous methods to estimate the crossing frequency trajectories which is a great challenge related to the low sample number   abstract in this  we consider nonstationary signals with nonlinear amplitude and frequency modulation on short time windows motivated by published works 3 4 where we obtain high performances for monocompnt signals we propose to extend the approach to multicompnt signals both the instantaneous amplitude and frequency were modeled by polynomial functions the maximization of the likelihood function was achieved  a stochastic optimization technique the simulated annealing we compare  different strategies the first  we simultaneously estimate all model parameters this is a highly computational strategy the second  consists in iteratively recontructing the signal compnt by compnt at each iteration the parameters of only  compnt are estimated monte carlo simulations are presented and compared to the appropriate cramer rao bounds it proves the efficiency of the algorithm moreover it underscores the performance to estimate crossing frequency trajectories which is a great challenge related to the low sample number   abstract parameter estimation for closely spaced or crossing frequency trajectories is a difficult signal processing problem especially in the presence of both nonlinear amplitude and frequency modulations in this  polynomial models are assumed for the instantaneous frequencies and amplitudes if ia we suggest  different strategies to process multicompnt signals in the first  which is optimal all model parameters are simultaneously estimated  a maximum likelihood procedure ml maximized via a stochastic technique called simulated annealing sa in the second strategy which is suboptimal the signal is iteratively reconstructed compnt by compnt at each iteration the if and ia of  compnt are estimated  the ml procedure and the sa technique to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed strategies monte carlo simulations are presented and compared to the derived cramer rao bounds for closely spaced and crossing frequency trajectories the results show the proposed algorithms perform well compared to

laboratory grenoble france a total of 20 signals are synchronously recorded including shaft acceleration signals in several positions torque rotation speed optical encoder signal of both shafts and currents and tensions of the non synchronous training motor after about 3500 hours of  this device the driving gear shaft broke at the gear coupling position with the training motor shaft which created an impressive helicoïdal crack this failure could be due to a flexion strain ca by a misalignment of the  shafts but this fault was not detected before in this  we compare results of different signal processing methods for the detection of this fault particularly we use the phase spectrogram whose advantage is to be able to highlight a slight phase modulation in signals that is not detectable on the amplitude spectrogram we also attempt to detect the fault  spectral analysis a non stationary modelling based on prony s model and comparison of signals recorded at different times before the crack the acceleration signals the torque and the torsional vibration signal obtained from the shaft encoder signal the detection results are compared and discussed between the different methods    the effect of phase reference on phase unwrapping and discrete fourier transform dft phase behavior are first illustrated by z transform with the finite sequence z transform and dft the phase is referenced at the first time sample of a n time samples window since the phase value is relative to this time position with a dft referenced like that without a spectral interpolation between frequency lines a spectral compnt has  or many line to line pi phase rotations below its main lobe and line to line 2pi phase rotation on the outside this 2pi rotation appear like a continuous quasi constant phase line to line conversely a dft referenced at the window center show a flat phase under a spectral compnt s main lobe and a pi phase rotation at every spectral line outside the main lobe this latter phase pattern facilitates phase unwrapping moreover the flat phase section under a main lobe simplifies the search for an optimal phase estimation algorithm with interpolated fast fourier transform ifft it has been demonstrated from the cramér rao bound that the variance on the phase is minimal at the center of the time window where it s suggest to put the phase reference for phase parameter estimation this explain why the high accuracy estimation algorithm which we developed like other algorithms developed by others authors is not only close to the frequency and amplitude estimation error lower bounds but also to the phase lower bound for a constant t when we reference the phase to the window center this  has been submitted to an ieee journal in june 1999 i have not received the reviewer comments but i guess that the  was too long and not well balanced between the algorithm and application description too narrow or too large on some subjects    this white  by

is to detail the models  in simulation and the results obtained in simulation for both machining and fsw process this report contains in a first part the details of modeling flexibilities of serial robots primarily through a model of localized flexibilities the flexibilities are expressed both in cartesian space and in the joint space and taking into account possible couplings the second part deals with the dynamic model  in the simulator and the simulation environment a significant work was to also model the company kuka robot controller machining processes and fsw are modeled by simple models but reflecting the reality of the behavior   abstract this  proposes to use a non linear observer to build the state and the external force of flexible manipulator robots during their machining composite materials processes or friction stir welding fsw processes these  different processes have a problem in common the flexibility of the robot can not be neglected that is to say the errors due to the deformation of the links should be taken into account however in most industrial robots the real positions and velocities of each link are not measured so in this study an observer is  to reconstruct the real angular positions and velocities of links by  the measured angular positions and the velocities of actuators a simulation by matlab simulink has been carried out with a 2 axis robot during its machining processes the  observer showed great performances in estimating the state of the robot position and velocity then in order to improve the tracking accuracy in the tool frame the state of the external force along the forward direction x and its normal direction y are required while they are also not measured by our robot a disturbance observer has been added to reconstruct the processing force a good precision during the  processes have been obtained  the latter this study contributes to solve the problem from the point of view of accuracies during the machining processes    a quantitative analysis of the excitonic luminescence efficiency in hexagonal boron nitride hbn is carried out by cathodoluminescence and compared with  other wide bandgap semiconductors zinc oxide and diamond a high value of 15 is found at 10 k for the hbn internal quantum yield almost  orders of magnitude higher than for diamond although both crystals present indirect bandgaps the hbn luminescence efficiency remains stable up to room temperature consistently with tightly bound excitons ab initio calculations of the exciton dispersion in bulk hbn confirm the lowest energy exciton is indirect with a theoretical binding energy equal to 300 mev in agreement with the observed thermal stability of luminescence the direct exciton is found with a binding energy of 670 mev in good agreement with previous reports its energy turns out to be 100 mev above the indirect  and finally solves the long standing debate on the stoke shift in bulk hbn the benefits of these findings for the understanding of atomic bn layer properties are discussed   abstract the problem of estimating nonstationary signals has been considered in many previous publications in this  we propose an alternative algorithm in order to accurately estimate am fm1 signals only single compnt signals are considered we perform local polynomial modeling on short time segments  a nonsequential strategy the degree of polynomial approximation is limited due to the shortness of each time segment the time support of a segment is controlled by a criterion defined on the spectrogram to keep optimality a maximum likelihood procedure estimates the local model parameters leading to a non linear equation system in r7 this is solved by a simulated annealing technique finally the local polynomial models are merged to reconstruct the entire signal model the  algorithm enables highly nonlinear am fm estimation and shows robustness even when signal to noise ratio snr is low the appropriate cramer rao bounds crb are presented for both polynomial phase and amplitude signals monte carlo simulations show that the  algorithm performs well finally our  method is illustrated  both numerical simulations

to drive a moving fluid inside a thin channel according to a principle similar to peristaltic pumping to promote this pumping effect the deformation of the wall must be as a traveling wave like with sufficiently high amplitude to transfer momentum to the fluid    we investigate the automatic differentiation of hybrid models viz models that may contain delays logical tests and discontinuities or loops we consider differentiation with respect to parameters initial conditions or the time we emphasize the case of a small number of derivations and iterated differentiations are mostly treated with a foccus on high order iterations of the same derivation the models we consider may involve arithmetic operations elementary functions logical tests but also more elaborate compnts such as delays integrators equations and differential equations solvers this survey has no pretention to exhaustivity but tries to fil a gap in the litterature where each kind of of compnt may be documented but seldom their common use the general approach is illustrated by computer algebra experiments stressing the interest of performing differentiation whenever possible on high level objects before any

treatment the dental literature reports major difficulties in achieving adequate analgesia to perform this emergency treatment especially in the case of mandibular molars in current practice short course orally administered corticotherapy is used for the management of oral pain of inflammatory origin the efficacy of intraosseous local steroid injections for irreversible pulpitis in mandibular molars has already been demonstrated but resulted in local comorbidities oral administration of short course prednisol is simple and safe but its efficacy to manage pain caused by irreversible pulpitis has not yet been demonstrated this trial aims to evaluate the noninferiority of short course orally administered corticotherapy versus partial endodontic treatment for the emergency care of irreversible pulpitis in mandibular molars methods designthis study is a noninferiority open label randomized controlled clinical trial conducted at the bordeaux university hospital  hundred and twenty subjects will be randomized in  1 1 parallel arms the intervention arm will receive  oral dose of prednisol 1 mg kg during the emergency visit followed by  morning dose each day for 3 days and the reference arm will receive partial endodontic treatment both groups will receive planned complete endodontic treatment 72 h after enrollment the primary outcome is the proportion of patients with pain intensity below 5 on a numeric scale 24 h after the emergency visit secondary outcomes include comfort during care the number of injected anesthetic cartridges when performing complete endodontic treatment the number of antalgic drugs and the number of patients coming back for consultation after 72 h discussionthis randomized trial will assess the ability of short term corticotherapy to reduce pain in irreversible pulpitis as a simple and rapid alternative to partial endodontic treatment and to enable planning of endodontic treatment in optimal analgesic conditions trial

bal this article presents the methodology coloured petri net tools and results achieved       not available    fault tolerance is an essential requirement for critical programming systems due to potential catastrophic consequences of faults several approaches to evaluate system reliability parameters exist today however their work is based on the assumptions that hardware and software failures happen independently the challenge in this field is to take into account the hardware software interactions in the evaluation of the model in the continuity of the cetim project belhadaoui et al 2007 whose principal objective is to define an integrated design of dependable mechatronic systems this work evaluates important reliability parameters of an embedded application in a stack processor architecture   dynamic models the first  stack processor emulator jallouli et al 2007 allows the study of dynamic performance and the evaluation of a fault tolerant technique the second  information flow approach hamidi et al 2005 evaluates the failure probability for each assembler instruction and for some program loops the main objective is to estimate the failure probability of the whole application the hierarchically modelling with the information flow approach makes it possible to evaluate the efficiency of protection program loops these loops ensure the fault tolerance policy by recovering imminent failures and allow the application to run successfully thanks to a permanent software recover mechanism in case of a detected and not corrected error the system returns to the last faultless state this work is useful because it allows adjusting the architecture and shows the advantages of the hardware software interactions during the co design phase before the hardware

those projects are suggested and designed by the students as part of their independent work it is important that each project contains theoretical mathematical work alongside technical aspects like the control and construction of electric devices members of komms support them by providing mathematical and technical expert knowledge and soft skill training during several workshops and by offering infrastructure for communication and computing    we discuss and compare robust hash functions for natural text with respect to their performance regarding text modification and natural language watermark embedding our goal is to identify algorithms suitable for efficiently identifying watermarked copies of ebooks before watermark detection    we discuss a modeling project in which students have to build a device that acts simultaneously to music either a musical fountain or a light organ we show how the incorporated university level mathematics can be reduced to the level of secondary education being product oriented the modeling activity has a strong interdisciplinary character we focus on  implementations of the project with high school students and discuss their results here we draw the attention to the role of mathematics in a stem project where the presence of programming and engineering seems more obvious than the mathematical content    well designed animations can improve the usability of graphical user interfaces for business software it is crucial in this area that the user considers animations to be helpful and that they do not decrease perceived work efficiency thus both the acceptance of animations and the selection of an appropriate animation speed are of high importance we investigate those aspects in three explorative studies results show that animated interactions are considered to be useful by a considerable majority of participants the observed settings for the animation speed show that quite fast animations are generally preferred we demonstrate that for some of these animations the observed settings for animation speed can be explained by cognitive modeling     introducing iterative user interface design methods into the development processes of safety critical software creates technical and methodological challenges this article describes a new programming paradigm aimed at addressing some of these challenges interaction oriented programming in this paradigm any piece of software consists of a hierarchical collection of compnts that can interact among themselves and with their environment and its execution consists in propagating activation through interactions between compnts we first describe the principles of interaction oriented programming and illustrate them by describing the basic compnts provided by the djnn programming framework to create interactive software we then show how interactive programming provides a basis for formulating and checking properties that capture requirements on interactive compnts the rest of the article is dedicated to example design and development scenarios that illustrate how development environments could leverage interactive programming in the future so as to jointly address the requirements of modern user interface design and safety critical software development     djnn is a general framework dedicated to the development of complex interactive systems we describe ongoing work aimed at developing verification mechanisms through the definition of syntax grammar and semantics for djnn models the results will serve to perform formal verification of interactive systems    automation is  of the key solutions  and adopted by international air transport research programs to meet the challenges of increasing air traffic for automation to be safe and usable it needs to be suitable to the activity it supports both when authoring it and when operating it here we present vizir a domain specific graphical language and an environment for authoring and operating airport automations we used a participatory design process with air traffic controllers to gather requirements for vizir and to design its features vizir combines visual interactionoriented programming constructs with activity related geographic areas and events vizir offers explicit humancontrol constructs graphical substrates and means to scaleup with multiple automations we propose a set of guidelines to inspire designers of similar usable hybrid humanautomation systems    a transmission experiment involving 5 week old specific pathogen free spf piglets with mda or without maternally derived antibodies mda was carried out to evaluate the impact of passive immunity on the transmission of a swine influenza a virus swiav in each group mda mda 2 seeders were placed with 4 piglets in direct contact and 5 in indirect contact 3 replicates per group serological kinetics elisa and individual viral shedding rt pcr were monitored for 28 days after infection mda waning was estimated  a nonlinear mixed effects model and survival analysis differential transmission rates were estimated depending on the piglets initial serological status and contact structure direct contact with pen mates or indirect airborne contact the time to mda waning was 71 3 52 8 92 1 days on average the airborne transmission rate was 1 41 0 64 2 63 per day the compared shedding pattern between groups showed that mda piglets had mainly a reduced susceptibility to infection compared to mda piglets the resulting reproduction number estimated in mda piglets 5 8 1 4 18 9 although 3 times lower than in mda piglets 14 8 6 4 27 1 was significantly higher than 1 such an efficient and extended spread of swiav at the population scale in the presence of mdas could contribute to swiav persistence on farms given the fact that the period when transmission is expected to be impacted by the presence of mdas can last up to 10 weeks    since the birth of the field hci has defined itself both as a theory of the relations between humans and numerical systems and as a practical activity that aims at building new interactive systems however hci has not yet succeeded in discovering a unified theoretical framework nor in building a strong link between both activities based on an analysis from various fields we show that most of the difficulties come from the computational paradigm that is still  as a foundation of most of the theories in hci this brings us to proposing a new philosophical view on the science of hci based on a process ontology we show how it accounts for several phenomena related to hci and unifies them this approach lends itself to new ways of thinking and programming interaction at di erent scales which may help hci scientists in their modelling and design activities    the persistent difficulty to develop and maintain interactive software has unveiled the inadequacy of traditional imperative programming languages in the recent years several solutions have been  to enrich the existing languages with constructs dedicated to interaction in this  we propose a different approach that takes interaction as the primary concern to build a new programming language we present djnn a conceptual framework based on the concepts of process and process activation then we introduce smala a programming language derived from this framework we propose a solution for the unification of the concepts of event and data flow and for the derivation of complex control structures from a small set of basic s we detail the syntax and the semantics of smala finally we illustrate through a real size application how it enables building all parts of an interactive software djnn and smala may offer designers and programmers usable means to think of interactions and translate them into running code    the study deals with the behavior of bolted joints between the wings and the fuselage of an airplane to study this complex structure we use a classical finite element code with a simplified model called macromodel to avoid a large number of degrees of freedom implied by a fine discretization of the local geometry and non linearities contact friction during previous studies the macromodel was constructed by simple springs the use of this type of macromodel in assembly simulations enables to define the most loaded bolt however these simple springs do not allow to take into account non linearities such as contact with friction to face this problem a new macromodel is considered    in plastic injection mould and prosthesis industries mirror effect polished surfaces are required for obtaining transparent parts or surfaces without scratches traditionally d manually we have  to automate polishing on 5 axis machining centre  a passive elastomeric carrier  of the main advantages of automatic polishing is the repeatability of the machine movements in order to achieve restricted form deviations however the material removal rate mrr during polishing depends on parameters such as contact pressure relative velocity and tool wear we have thus developed a model dedicated to our process to compute the effective mrr along the polishing tool path regarding the contact area and the contact pressure between the tool and the part    current manufacturing industries are experiencing a paradigm shift towards more flexibility to respond quickly and efficiently to constant changing customers requirements new technologies and increasing product variety product flexibility is the ability of the manufacturing system to cope with the growing product variety to ensure better system performance the aim of this  is to point out the importance of product resources interfaces in product flexibility assessment based on industrial experience three product flexibility inductors are identified which are gripping setting and tooling interfaces in order to build indicators as close as possible to real industry conditions this research work investigates new factors to quantify product flexibility and provide manufacturing system designers with efficient decision making support tools in order to show the relevance of our approach experimental results from the automotive industry are presented    this  discusses automatic regulation in participative web systems we present a generic solution with an original trace centered approach we describe an experiment with a general trace based system tbs called carte collection activity analysis and regulation based on traces enriched featuring a regulation mechanism and we couple this system with an on line generic platform for managing lexical resources called jibikipedia       a value risk based performance evaluation framework is  in the context of manufacturing processes at the industrialization phase of product development various risk factors of the manufacturing process are identified through failure mode and effect analysis fmea and then embedded in the process plan models modelling and simulation are then employed for determining the value a process plan can create and the risk it is exposed to alternative scenarios are developed simulated and compared with a reference scenario the methodology is illustrated with a case study issued from parts manufacturing but is applicable to a wide range of other processes    this  deals with tolerance allocation driven by an activity based approach its main objective is to rationally give a good indicator of the relevance of tolerances values fixed by designers taking into consideration the impacts of tolerance allocation on the manufacturing process and so the production cost several examples are given to illustrate this concept moreover this  deals with how the geometrical analysis can be carried out in this activity framework illustrated several industrial cases finally this  explains how coupled with an optimization algorithm this method can generate the best compromise between cost and high performance to illustrate the efficiency of this approach and its realization models and user interfaces based on an industrial case are given    today internet technology proposes communication exchange and data storage powerful tools they are standardized and accessible to the companies but usually they are not adapted for a mechanical design use and they do not take into account the design process so in this context we present a method allowing the definition of real needs for collaborative engineering in terms of creation management and exchange of technical data and more specially geometrical data from the results of this analysis we propose a model on which is based a geometrical modelling methodology for mechanical products in a integrated design and collaborative engineering context    this  proposes an optimization framework for inspection planning based on a mixed integer non linear programming minlp model in which decisions are made on what kinds of quality characteristics need which kind of inspections and where these inspections should be taken place such that total cost of production is minimized  different types of inspections containing monitoring inspection mi and conformity inspection ci are taken into account in order to validate the correctness of the model a real industrial case is studied since the size of problems is large a genetic based algorithm is developed to solve the real industrial case    abstract the research concerns automated generation of process plans  knowledge formalization and capitalization tools allowing designers to deal with issues and specifications of the machining domain are taken into account the main objective of the current work is to prevent designers from designing solutions that would be expensive and difficult to machine among all available solutions to achieve this goal  are distinguished the generative approach and the analogy approach the generative approach is more adapted to generate the machining plans of parts composed of numerous boring operations in interaction however generative systems have  major problems proposed solutions are often too numerous and are only geometrically but not technologically relevant in order to overcome these drawbacks  new concepts of feature and three control algorithms are developed the  presents the  new features the machining enabled geometrical feature megf and the machinable features mbf this development is the result of the separation of the geometrical and the technological data contained in  machining feature the second objective of the  is to improve the current process ascending generation pag system with control algorithms in order to limit the combinatorial explosion and disable the generation of unusable or not machinable solutions    during recent decades there has been growing awareness of human safety in the design process the purpose of this  is to review the literature on design for human safety dfhs in manufacturing systems to this end a process for systematically reviewing dfhs studies was  the authors foc in particular on the applications of design theories and methodologies dtm and design tools and techniques dtt to analyse and identify work situations in order to improve human safety in manufacturing system design the authors also tried to identify the design phases in which these dtm and dtt could be applied this research review covered s published between 1980 and 2015 and combined seven groups of terms dfhs design safety dtm dtt risk and working situation a critical analysis was also performed in view to defining a research agenda and the most prominent key actions capable of pointing out paths for future research      cost engineering key objectives is to ensure cost estimates accuracy and to avoid cost overruns in such a global context this  focuses on the manner through which the uncertainties as well as variations impact the cost dimensions during different phases of product lifecycle tolerance allocation process planning inspection planning what is investigated is the adaptability of a modified activity based costing model in evaluation of cost regarding the activities in different stages of the product s life cycle this effective model encloses the cost estimation of tolerancing process and inspection planning via the impact of variations and uncertainties i e inspection risk the aim is to take into account not only the cost but also the quality quality driven activity based costing of product    this  presents an intelligent knowledge based integrated manufacturing system  the step feature based modeling and rule based intelligent techniques to generate suitable process plans for prismatic parts the system carries out several stages of process planning such as identification of the pairs of feature tool that satisfy the required conditions generation of the possible process plans from identified tools machine pairs and selection of the most interesting process plans considering the economical or timing indicators the suitable processes plans are selected according to the acceptable range of quality time and cost factors each process plan is represented in the tree format by the information items corresponding to their cnc machine required tools characteristics times machining setup preparatory and the required machining sequences the process simulation module is provided to demonstrate the different sequences of machining after selection of suitable process plan the g code language  by cnc machines is generated automatically this approach is validated through a case    the choice of an adapted production system is essential in today s volatile market environment for this choice the identification of common and distinct assemblies in between the product variants is of high importance this  presents four new similarity indices which are aggregated to categorize products the categorization will support the choice of an assembly system type dedicated reconfigurable or hybrid for a selection of product subassemblies when designing a new production facility on this way operational areas for a reconfigurable system can be defined the novel approach is applied to an industrial case study in automotive industry     additive manufacturing am has first emerged in 1987 with the invention of stereolithography the am is an important rapidly emerging manufacturing technology that takes the information from a computer aided design cad and builds parts in a layer by layer style as this technology offers many advantages such as manufacturing of complex geometries reducing manufacturing cost and energy consumption it has transformed manufacturing from the mass production to the mass customization also it has found wide applications in several fields although some drawbacks this  presents the state of the art of the different am processes the material processing issues and the post processing operations a comparison between am and conventional processes is presented as well we finish by presenting some prospects of this technology such as hybrid manufacturing and 4d printing     an increased and ongoing trend to more product variety can be observed in manufacturing industries this trend implies that enterprises have to deal with more and more differing products which leads to challenges on both sides the product design and the production the improvement of production being an important factor the challenge on the side of the design department is not minor between design for manufacturing assembly and increasing demands in terms of customisation the management of highly varying products and the generation of coherent product families is of great importance this article presents a new design improvement methodology based on  physical and functional architecture similarity indices and  assembly technology similarity indices it aims to guide the designer in the analysis of product similarity the identification of product subassemblies to optimise and the choice of consistent assembly solutions for an easier product family generation and optimised production a case study from automotive industry is presented to illustrate the application of this approach    this  describe the ongoing work jointly between inrs and lcfc ensam to take risk prevention into account in the specification drawn up when considering buying or designing work equipment special machine individual workstation assembly line etc the methodology is based on the functional need analysis and the concept of work situations as defined by inrs in their previous research work the aim is to bring together the user and the designer in a dynamic of dialogue in order to define the main work situations and not only the technical system an overview of the problem is first described followed by a brief review of methods currently in use we then describe the different steps involved in the  methodology before examining the results of a case study application to a milling machine in which the benefits of such an approach and its acceptability by sme smis are assessed     a product design goes through a digital mock up which is based on the product geometric model this latter has an important role in the design project whose exploitation mainly depends on how it has been established 1 furthermore the growing competitive context hardly encourages firms to implement new working methods like collaborative engineering however its implementation in combination with product geometric data generates many problems in terms of project and data management for this purpose this article proposes a methodological solution to the problem at hand moreover the problem gets complicated as the project progresses as a result the detailed design phase becomes critical particularly in the face of this problem therefore the current article focuses on this phase of the product design process through an example     in this study we design a reliable logistics nerk based on a hub location problem which is less sensitive to disruption and it performs efficiently when disruption occurs a new mixed integer programming model is  to minimize the total sum of the nominal and expected failure costs this model considers complete and partial disruption at hubs in addition we propose a new hybrid meta heuristic algorithm based on genetic and imperialist competitive algorithms we compare the performance of the  al gorithm with a new lower bound method in terms of the cpu time and solution quality furthermore we conclude that a considerable improvement in the reliability of the net work can be achieved with only a slight increase in the total cost finally we demonstrate that the nerks designed  our model are less conservative and more robust to disruption compared with those designed based on other robustness measures    conventional machining process planning approaches are inefficient to handle the process planning complexity induced by part variety reconfigurable process planning is a new process planning approach which has been well recognized as a key enabler for current manufacturing paradigms however in the literature there is neither a comprehensive part variety representation model to support reconfigurable process planning nor a global solution framework to instruct the generation of the feasible process plans for a specific part variant therefore this  extends the concept of reconfigurable process planning to a concept of reconfigurable machining process planning which targets the process plan generation for a part family a solution framework is developed for reconfigurable machining process planning in this framework a feature based part variety model is  to represent a part family a reconfigurable machining process plan is defined as a set of modular compnts which can be configured reconfigured into the machining process plans for any part variant in the family a novel configuration approach is  to generate the process plan compnts for a specific part variant while configuring this part variant from the family the feasibility and effectiveness of the  framework and models are tested in a real case study    cyber physical systems cpss play a crucial role in the industry 4 0 paradigm the application of cpss in production environments gave rise to the term cyber physical production systems cppss the emergence of cppss transforms the automation pyramid into a decentralized structure manufacturing execution systems mes are being highly influenced by this transformation currently there remains a dispute on the role of mes in cppss specifically with respect to the functions they support in cppss this  aims to shed light on the role of mes in cppss by analyzing the functional models of the  firstly functional models of cppss and mes are  in the form of idef0 diagrams then data flows between the functional models of cppss and mes are described and the functions of the  are compared we find that mes will continue to play a significant role in cppss but it will take new forms the next generation of mes requires greater flexibility dynamism and improved functionality     market dynamics of today are constantly evolving in the presence of emerging technologies such as additive manufacturing am drivers such as mass customization strategies high part complexity needs shorter prod uct development cycles a large pool of materials to choose from abundant manufacturing processes diverse streams of applications e g aerospace motor vehicles and health care and high cost incurred due to manufac turability of the part have made it essential to choose the right compromise of materials manufacturing processes and associated machines in early stages of design considering the design for additive manufacturing guidelines there exists a complex relationship between am products and their process data however the literature to date shows very less studies targeting this integration as several criteria material attributes and process function ality requirements are involved for decision making in the industries this  introduces a generic decision methodology based on multi criteria decision making tools that will not only provide a set of compromised am materials processes and machines but will also act as a guideline for designers to achieve a strong foothold in the am industry by providing practical solutions containing design oriented and feasible material machine com binations from a current database of 38 renowned am vendors in the world an industrial case study related to aerospace has also been tested in detail via the  methodology        the european directive 2006 42 ce promulgates the machine safe design principles to prevent professional risks however outside machines that have specific safety standards the designers of special machines and manufacturing systems can only use generic safety standards limiting as a consequence the results of hazards detection the aim of this  is to present an original approach for this detection during the design of working equipment we based our study on a hypothesis of the literature that links hazards to the presence of energy flows thus the hazards detection is reduced to the study of the building of energy flows and the detection of potential links between these flows and the operator thanks to such data the designer will be able to select the best risk prevention solutions to reach this goal we decided to use the functional energetic model femo to model the technical system and its energy flows this choice was made because this model was developed for the design of technical systems integrating different types of energy by  this modelling the designer can easily analyses every potential interactions between the energy flows and the operator depending on the future working situations in each life cycle phases our approach builds on this model all along the design process allowing the designer to early detect hazards and to apply at the best moment the risk prevention solutions we present the application of this approach during the design of a working equipment since the definition of the raw need we confirm that its application and the system modelling in the efm formalism are possible since the conceptual design phase data from the next design phases enrich the model and consequently improve the detection and characterization of hazards       manufacturing machine designers must take into account different aspects of products such as technology legislation and occupational safety european directive 2006 42 ce promulgates machine safety design principles to prevent occupational risks aimed at machine designers its objective is to set out the need to obtain the lowest possible risk level according to the state of the art although the designers of catalog machines have access to specific standards to perform a priori risk analyses this is not the case for special machine designers an original approach called ezid is presented in this  to help all machine designers in the task of hazard identification based on the fact that hazards are linked to the presence of energies ezid identifies hazards through the detection of design parameters linked to energy sources and flows it then feeds back organized information to designers on every potential exchange of energy between the machine and its operators bringing to light the need to add risk prevention solutions the first part provides a detailed classification of energy parameters considered to be the primary indicators of hazards this is followed by an explanation of the logical rules describing how damage is generated by the combination of the other design parameters increasing the level of detail in hazard identification the next part focuses on the characterization of significant hazards finally the results obtained from  this approach during the industrial design of a supply line are presented to confirm that ezid is functional from the earliest stage of design    a process oriented quantitative risk assessment methodology is  risks involved in a process and the corresponding risk factors are identified through a novel objective oriented risk identification approach and analyzed qualitatively in the process fmea critical risks with high rpn risk priority number values identified in the fmea are incorporated in the process model for further quantitative analysis in the simulation environment to this end risk measures of the critical risks are determined for which data is collected during simulation execution  the  methodology as a decision making tool alternative scenarios are developed and compared with each other as well as with  fictive situations to elicit normalized values for the risk measures employing value function approach to ease the decision making process in case of multiple risk measures a global risk indicator is developed by aggregating the individual normalized risk measures through a 2 additive choquet integral operator the global risk indicator is then used to rank the alternative scenarios on the basis of desirability the methodology is illustrated with a case study issued from parts manufacturing but is applicable to a wide range of other processes    this  is dedicated to integrated safety which is dealing to apply as soon as possible safe machine design principle more human in the factory is  of the main themes of the factory of the future paradigm despite of current researches on design methodologies and standards practical uses of this approach are not yet perfect in order to answer to these objectives inrs and ensam have signed a research agreement in order to gives to the machine or manufacturing systems designers structured methods models tools and so to help them during the design process this  present studies carrying out results obtained following the axis working equipment requirements preliminary design of manufacturing equipment taking account of health and safety    nowadays manufacturing systems should be cost effective and environmentally friendly to cope with various challenges in today s competitive markets furthermore being cost effective needs to optimize the behaviour and functionality of the production system and being environmentally friendly requires to reduce the amount of harmful gasses emitted in the working area in this context reconfigurable manufacturing systems rmss have emerged to fulfil these requirements rms is  of the latest manufacturing paradigms where machines compnts software or material handling units can be added removed modified or interchanged as needed and when imposed by the necessity to react and respond rapidly and cost effectively to changing in this  a multi objective multi product process and production planning problem in a sustainable reconfigurable manufacturing environment is considered the cost function and three pillars of sustainability functions such as social environmental and economical are introduced and optimized moreover an augmented ε constraint method is  to solve the problem finally an illustrative numerical example is presented to show the validity of the approach    human in the factory is  of the main themes of the factory of the future in this context the aim of this  is to present the new issues for workers safety and the in tegrated design concepts or methodologies which have to be taking into account new paradigms come into being the uncertainty of the demand in terms of products as well as production rate product customization integration product service the man ufacturing processes are not fixed so the manufacturing times cannot be foreseen re configuration of machine tools as manufacturing systems space organization auto organization planning new technologies are implemented robots plug and play devices virtual augmented reality sensors opc standards connected objects several tasks are performed by the workers the robots or in collaboration the work ers are place in the center of the factory of the future but this concept introduce haz ard events problems of health and safety physical or cognitive tasks fatigue stress space or time organization interfaces human robot to take into account of the dif ferent life situations so the aim of the  is to present studies carrying out in order to propose to the machine or manufacturing systems designers as well as pro duction managers structured methods models tools in order to get safe working sit uations in the frame of the factory of the future paradigm     design for human safety is a complex issue because of the variability of human activities machines and their environment as well as the variability of possible interactions between these compnts the work situation is comprised of the means and the person s who act to carry out task s in a working environment in accordance with the conditions set for carrying out the task s the work situation can generate the hazardous conditions and undesirables events lead to harm this  deals with the work situation identifying and analyzing during design to improve safety product service system pss which is an integrated combination of products and services that shift from product and service systems to product service systems has been used the function behavior structure fbs which covers behavior is considered to include product and its utilization the interaction between pss and fbs  in present  allows considering product behaviors and its interaction with service activities this allows to distinguish the realization of functions by a product part a service part or a combination of both the analysis of this interaction is helpful for work situation analysis product and service behaviors modeling also are  in order to help this analysis the applicability of the  approach is demonstrated through the application to the power take off pto drive shaft     in this  a bi objective mixed integer linear programming bomilp model for planning of an inspection process used to detect nonconforming products and malfunctioning processors in a multi stage serial production system is presented the model involves  inter related decisions 1 which quality characteristics need what kind of inspections i e which what decision and 2 when the inspection of these characteristics should be performed i e when decision these decisions require a trade off between the cost of manufacturing i e production inspection and scrap costs and the customer satisfaction due to inevitable variations in the manufacturing systems a global robust bomilp rbomilp is developed to tackle the inherent uncertainty of the concerned parameters i e production and inspection times errors type i and ii misadjustment and dispersion of the process in order to optimally solve the presented rbomilp model a meta heuristic algorithm namely differential evolution de algorithm is combined with the taguchi and monte carlo methods the  model and solution algorithm are validated through a real industrial case from a leading automotive industry in france     a new performance measurement and management framework based on value and risk is  the  framework is applied to the modelling and evaluation of the a priori performance evaluation of manufacturing processes and to deciding on their alternatives for this reason it consistently integrates concepts relevant to objectives activity and risk in a single framework comprising a conceptual value risk model and it conceptualises the idea of value and risk based performance management in a process context in addition a methodological framework is developed to provide guidelines for the decision makers or performance evaluators of the processes to facilitate the performance measurement and management process this latter framework is organized in four phases context establishment performance modelling performance assessment and decision making each phase of the framework is then instrumented with state of the art quantitative analysis tools and methods for process design and evaluation the deliverable of the value and risk based performance measurement and management system vr pms is a set of ranked solutions i e alternative business processes evaluated against the developed value and risk indicators the  vr pms is illustrated with a case study from discrete parts manufacturing but is indeed applicable to a wide range of processes or systems    manufacturing enterprises are facing a competitive challenge this  proposes the use of a value chain based approach to support the modelling and simulation of manufacturing enterprise processes the aim is to help experts to make relevant decisions on product design and or product manufacturing process planning this decision tool is based on the value chain modelling by considering the product requirements in order to evaluate several performance indicators a

integration during the different stages of production system s design process by  functional analysis or failure mode analysis to predict unusual production means uses flow simulation or digital human models to consider variability due to human factors the designer can better comprehend the variability in the future systems and thus define adequate temporal margins which optimize performance and workers wellbeing   abstract the work of product designers has to evolve in phase with the improvements made to technology and changes in regulations they have to work on different aspects of a product such as its technological legal environmental and occupational safety implications european directive 2006 42 ce promulgates safe machine design principles to prevent professional risks these principles guide machine designers to reduce residual risks as much as the technological state of the art permits special machine designers are by definition confronted by a lack of specific standards relating to a priori risk analysis the aim of this  is to present an original approach to help them to identify hazards upstream and also throughout the design process this approach is based on the fact that hazards are linked to the presence of energies hazard identification can be d through the detection of parameters linked to energy sources and flows the approach then feeds back information to designers about potential contacts between energies and workers to highlight the need to add preventive measures we use the functional structural model is used to represent the machine energy architecture through the different steps of its lifecycle thus it is possible to identify every interface through which energies circulate these interfaces are defined by  kinds of parameter energetic parameters linked to energy properties and other design parameters this  first presents a detailed classification of energetic parameters that are also indicators of the hazards present in the machine we then present logical rules for processing these energetic parameters and others in order to increase the accuracy of the hazard identification performed to conclude the results obtained from  this approach during the industrial design of a supply line is detailed to validate the pertinence of its application from the earliest design stages with improved accuracy during the subsequent design

achieve a linear weld however more investigation on a curved friction stir weld trajectory is still required to industrialize this promising process in the same perspective this study is aimed at analyzing the influence of nonlinear tool trajectory in friction stir welding the study considers a variety of circular trajectories on the plane plate and uses them for experimentation while considering different welding parameters of rotation speed feed speed axial force and tilt angle in fsw the tool is generally needed to be tilted with a constant angle in the travel direction during welding process therefore for circular trajectory an adequate roll and pitch angle are assigned to the spindle in all tool positions the  presents the effect of circular trajectory on longitudinal and transversal forces generated during circular welding the results are then compared with the experimental results which are obtained  linear fsw furthermore the experimental investigation includes relationship between tool trajectory and weld quality            wire arc additive manufacturing is a new process  a common weldingrobotic cell to build large parts layer by layer it allows building

industrialisation    nowadays industrial robots are used in many manufacturing applications because of their versatility and easy applicability notwithstanding their performance these robots are not suitable for some manufacturing processes where uniform and high forces together with suitable precision of position are required the present research is focused on the robotization of  of the high thrust operations the friction stir welding fsw this method for connecting  parts works while the connected materials are in the solid phase for this reason a very high axial force is needed to soften the material during the welding process due to these high forces the position of the tool of a serial robot deviates from the desired trajectory in this phd work the possibility of  a parallel structure device is investigated to improve the load capacity and stiffness of a heavy loadmanipulator robot in a first part the geometric kinematic and dynamic modeling and the flexibility of an industrial robot kuka kr500 2mt are developed by locating flexibility at the joints the second part is to improve the performance of the fsw process  an industrial robot so different methods are examined the modification of the gravity compensation system the addition of an additional mass on the tool the addition of a parallel structure and the use of a cooperative system the last  solutions exert forces directly on the process tool in this way the movement of the tool is mainly generated by the industrial serial robot while the assistive device either the parallel structure or the second robot used in the cooperatif system ensures the generation of very high axial forces optimization algorithms are developed to minimize deviations and thus reduce welding defects finally a study of the workspace is studied  catia software knowledge of the system workspace with the proposed solutions allows to estimate the possible welding applications that can be achieved  these systems    the use of industrial robots for machining or grinding operations becomes a necessity however the robotization of grinding processes faces several obstacles that arise especially when grinding large workpieces process robotization also requires the definition of an efficient methodology for planning the robot trajectory this methodology should reduce the grinding time and at the same time guarantee that the desired surface finish is obtained in the framework of this thesis we will propose a practical solution for the robotization of the grinding process    the multi material forging is a forming process allowing simultaneously the welding and shaping of multi material parts with the right material at the right place the purpose of the presented work is to identify the necessary conditions to obtain a metallurgical bond during forming between  different grades of steel first the state of the art allowed the identification of the physical phenomena occurring during multi material forging and the determination of the key parameters of the bonding which are the contact pressure and the surface expansion at the both sides of the interface the mechanisms to establish metallurgical bond by forging are based on the breaking and the dispersion of the oxide layer at the interface then the extrusion of the soft material through the voids generated between the oxide fragments second the characterization methodology of this work is presented it consists of three simple forming tests leading to different interface conditions contact pressure and surface expansion the first simulations allow the design of the experimental plan for each test the comparison between simulations and experiments allows the identification of physical parameters of the simulation then the contact pressure and the surface expansion of the identified simulations are  to analyze the metallographic structure and the bonding at the interface the developed work confirms the major effect of the contact pressure and the surface expansion on the establishment of a metallurgical bond during multi material forming the size and the shape of the oxide particles seem to depend on the thermomechanical path at the interface     this chapter presents a digital mediation experiment based on the minecraft video game and aimed at apprehending the production of urban space in the city of

cellular samples at very high spatio temporal resolutions we built a lls microscope in which we added a photo stimulation path to perform all optical neurophysiological studies in rodent hippocampal brain slices thanks to the photo stimulation path we could achieve fluorescence recovery after photobleaching frap or glutamate uncaging at spatially and temporally controlled regions of interest several fluorescence labelling protocols were employed depending on the imaged structure sub micrometric neuronal elements such as spines or dendritic vesicles could be imaged down to 20 µm below the

when applicable    additive manufacturing am became an advanced research topic due to its ability to manufacture complex shapes but the ability to achieve predictable and repeatable shapes is critical therefore to optimize the design of an additive manufactured product tolerancing is a key issue this  focuses on geometrical quality assessment of an am product it includes a process oriented geometrical model to predict the surface roughness and dimensional deviations and a geometrical simulation tool to assess the impacts of these deviations on the geometrical behaviour of the joint an application of the approach is illustrated through a case study   abstract tolerance analysis aims on checking whether specified tolerances enable functional and assembly requirements the tolerance analysis approaches discussed in literature are generally assumed without the consideration of parts form defects this  presents a new model to consider the form defects in an assembly simulation a metric modal decomposition mmd method is henceforth developed to model the form defects of various parts in a mechanism the assemblies including form defects are further assessed  mathematical optimization the optimization involves  models of surfaces real model and difference surface base method and introduces the concept of signed distance the optimization algorithms are then compared in terms of time consumption and accuracy to illustrate the methods and their respective applications a simplified over constrained industrial mechanism in three dimensions is also  as a case study    the statistical tolerance analysis has become a key element used in the design stage to reduce the manufacturing cost the rejection rate and to have high quality products  of the frequently used methods is the monte carlo simulation employed to compute the non conformity rate due to its efficiency in handling the tolerance analysis of over constrained mechanical systems however this simulation technique requires excessive numerical efforts the goal of this  is to improve this method by proposing a probabilistic model of gaps in fixed and sliding contacts and involved in the tolerance analysis of an assembly the probabilistic model is carried out on the clearance compnts of the sliding and fixed contacts for their assembly feasibility considering all the imperfections on the surfaces the kernel density estimation method is used to deal with the probabilistic model the  method is applied to an over constrained mechanical system and compared to the classical method regarding their computation time    tolerance analysis aims toward the verification of the impact of individual tolerances on the assembly and functional requirements of a mechanical system the manufactured products have several types of contacts and their geometry is imperfect which may lead to non functioning and non assembly traditional methods for tolerance analysis do not consider the form defects this thesis aims to propose a new procedure for tolerance analysis which considers the form defects and the different types of contact in its geometrical behavior modeling a method is firstly  to model the form defects to make realistic analysis thereafter form defects are integrated in the geometrical behavior modeling of a mechanical system and by considering also the different types of contacts indeed these different contacts behave differently once the imperfections are considered the monte carlo simulation coupled with an optimization technique is chosen as the method to perform the tolerance analysis ntheless this method is subject to excessive numerical efforts to overcome this problem probabilistic models  the kernel density estimation method are     additive

illustrated through a case study    assembly process planning is a highly knowledge intensive work as collaborative design and manufacturing is getting increasingly popular especially for complex assembly products assembly process planning knowledge model should be comprehensive recognizable and reusable ontology meets the requirements as a semantic tool providing a source of shared and precisely defined terms that can be utilized to describe both knowledge and concepts many researchers have studied the ontology modeling for assembly process planning domain and they mainly focus on the geometry information tolerance type and manufacture environment respectively this  presents an assembly process design knowledge ontology considering assembly requirement spatial information assembly operation and assembly resource it has covered almost every important concept related to assembly process planning knowledge    purpose  major problem preventing further application and benefits from additive manufacturing am nowadays is that am build parts always end up with poor geometrical quality to help improving geometrical quality for am this study aims to propose geometrical deviation identification and prediction method for am which could be used for identifying the factors forms and values of geometrical deviation of am parts design methodology approach this  applied the skin model based modal decomposition approach to describe the geometrical déviations of am and decompose them into different defect modes on that basis the approach to propose and extend defect modes was developed identification and prediction of the geometrical deviations were then carried out with this method finally a case study with cylinders manufactured by fused deposition modeling was introduced  coordinate measuring machine cmm machines with different measure methods were used to verify the effectiveness of the methods and modes proposed findings the case study results with  different cmm machines are very close which shows that the method and modes proposed by this  are very effective also the results indicate that the main geometrical defects are caused by the shrinkage and machine inaccuracy induced errors which have not been studied enough originality value this work could be used for identifying and predicting the forms and values of am geometrical deviation which could help realize the improvement of am part geometrical quality in design phase more purposefully    exfoliation syndrome xfs is the commst known risk factor for secondary glaucoma and a significant cause of blindness worldwide variants in  genes loxl1 and cacna1a have been previously associated with xfs to further elucidate the genetic basis of xfs we collected a global sample of xfs cases to refine the association at loxl1 which previously showed inconsistent results between populations and to identify new variants associated with xfs we identified a rare protective allele at loxl1 p 407phe or 25 p 2 9 x 10 14 through deep resequencing of xfs cases and controls from 9 countries this variant results in increased cellular adhesion strength compared to the wild type p 407tyr allele a

for naturally occurring rare loxl1 variants in disease biology    we present a new algorithm for detecting foreground and moving shadows in surveillance videos for each pixel we use the gaussian mixture model gmm to learn the behavior of cast shadows on background surfaces the pixelbased model has the advantages over regional or global model for their adaptability to local lighting conditions particularly for scenes under complex illumination conditions however it would take a long time for convergence if motion is rare on that pixel we hence build a global shadow model that uses global level information to overcome this drawback the local shadow models are updated through confidence rated gmm learning in which the learning rate depends on the confidence predicted by the global shadow model for foreground modeling we use a nonparametric density estimation method to model the complex characteristics of the spatial and color information finally the background shadow and foreground models are built into a markov random field energy function that can be efficiently minimized by the graph cut algorithm experimental results on various scene types demonstrate the effectiveness of the  method    in this  we propose a fast re coloring algorithm to improve the accessibility for the color vision impaired compared to people with normal color vision people with color vision impairment have difficulty in distinguishing between certain combinations of colors this may hinder visual communication owing to the increasing use of colors in recent years to address this problem we re map the hue compnts in the hsv color space based on the statistics of local characteristics of the original color image we enhance the color contrast through generalized histogram equalization a control parameter is provided for various users to specify the degree of enhancement to meet their needs experimental results are illustrated to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the  re coloring algorithm    view identi cation is the basal process for solid reconstruc tion from engineering drawings a new method is presented to label various views from a section

alphaherpesvirinae subfamily the characteristics of some dev genes have been reported however information regarding the dev ul47 gene is limited in this study we identified the dev ul47 gene encoding a late structural protein located in the nucleus of infected cells we further found that  domains of dev pul47 amino acids aa 40 to 50 and 768 to 777 could function as nuclear localization sequence nls to guide the nuclear localization of pul47 and nuclear translocation of heterologous proteins including enhanced green fluorescent protein egfp and beta galactosidase β gal moreover pul47

pigs play an important role in the transmission of human trichinellosis characterizing the immune response to t spiralis infection is key to elucidating host parasite interactions however most studies on the immune response to t spiralis infection have employed murine models in this study we investigated the immune response to t spiralis infection in pigs the results showed that the average numbers of larvae per gram lpg for the 100 muscle larvae ml 1000 ml and 10 000 ml groups were 1 502 35 947 and 398 811 respectively the percentages of cd3 t cells b cells cd4 t cells treg cells and th17 cells were elevated in the infection groups compared to the control animals in contrast cd8 t cell percentages were reduced after infection in the low dose group the number of neutrophils was increased at 3 17 days post infection dpi th1 cytokine il 2 levels were significantly decreased at 7 dpi and th2 cytokine il 4 levels were significantly elevated at 3 dpi treg cytokine il 10 levels were significantly elevated between 7 dpi and 30 dpi th17 cytokine il 17a levels were significantly increased beginning at 11 dpi these results confirmed that pigs infected with t spiralis predominantly induced th2 and treg immune responses which suppress the th1 immune responses this study provides novel insights into the immune response of pigs infected with t spiralis    selector devices are indispensable compnts of large scale nonvolatile memory and neuromorphic array systems besides the conventional silicon transistor  terminal ovonic threshold switching device with much higher scalability is currently the most industrially favored selector technology however current ovonic threshold switching devices rely heavily on intricate control of material stoichiometry and generally suffer from toxic and complex dopants here we report on a selector with a large drive current density of 34 ma cm 2 and a 10 6 high nonlinearity realized in an environment friendly and earth abundant sulfide binary semiconductor ges both experiments and first principles calculations reveal ge pyramid dominated nerk and high density of near valence band trap states in amorphous ges the high drive current capacity is associated with the strong ge s covalency and the high nonlinearity could arise from the synergy of the mid gap traps assisted electronic transition and local ge ge chain growth as well as locally enhanced bond alignment under high electric field    four versions of tricistronic vectors expressing igg1 light chain lc igg1 heavy chain hc and dihydrofolate reductase dhfr in  transcript were designed to compare internal ribosome entry site ires and furin 2a f2a for their influence on monoclonal antibody mab expression level and quality in cho dg44 cells lc and hc genes are arranged as either the first or the second cistron when  mab quantification methods based on the detection antibodies against hc fc region f2a mediated tricistronic vectors appeared to express mab at higher levels than the ires mediated tricistronic vectors in both transient and stable transfections further analysis revealed that more than 40 of products detected in stably transfected pools generated  the  f2a mediated tricistronic vectors were aggregates lc and hc from the f2a stably transfected pools were not properly processed giving rise to lc f2a hc or hc f2a lc fusion proteins lc and hc polypeptides with f2a remnants and incorrectly cleaved signal peptides both ires mediated tricistronic vectors express mab with correct sizes and signal peptide cleavage arrangement of lc as the first cistron in the ires mediated tricistronic vectors exhibits increased mab expression level better growth and minimized product aggregation while arrangement of hc as first cistron results in low expression slower growth and high aggregation the results obtained will be beneficial for designing vectors that enhance mab expression level and quality in mammalian cells    the lack of

principal compnts analysis pca techniques for discriminating and classifying the normal and stressed paddy rice oryza sativa l leaves ca by rice leaf folder cnaphalocrocis medinalis guen the hyperspectral reflectance of paddy rice leaves was measured through the full wavelength range from 350 to 2500nm under the laboratory condition the hyperspectral response characteristic analysis of rice leaves indicated that the stressed leaves presented a higher reflectance in the visible 430 470 nm 490 610 nm and 610 680 nm and  shortwave infrared 2080 2350 nm region and a lower reflectance in the near infrared 780 890 nm and the other shortwave infrared 1580 1750 nm region than the normal leaves pca was performed to obtain the principal compnts pcs derived from the raw and first derivative

under the laboratory condition    due to the unique transformation induced plasticity trip effect 304 austenitic stainless steel ass is widely used in many engineering areas during working and manufacturing process or in service it may undergo deformation over a wide range of strain rates and temperatures the current work presents a systematic deformation behavior study of 304 ass by both experiments and numerical simulations with an original cooling device coupled to the split hopkinson pressure bar system the compression behavior at strain rates between 0 001 s 1 and 3000 s 1 and temperatures between 163 c and 172 c was investigated an extension of the rusinek klepaczko rk model considering strain induced martensitic transformation simt phenomenon was also used to simulate the thermo viscoplastic behavior of this steel to study the deformation behavior at extremely high strain rates exceeding 3000 s 1 a new single shear z sss specimen has been  and validated then the effects of strain rate between 3000 s 1 and 39000 s 1 was analyzed finally with a specially designed cooling device the ballistic impact behavior under initial projectile velocities between 80 and 180 m s 1 and temperatures between 163 c and 200 c was studied by comparison between experiments and numerical simulations for perforation the previously obtained constitutive relations were validated     non uniform solar flux may lead to negative effects in the receiver of the linear fresnel reflector lfr including the failure of the receiver and the fluctuating operation for reducing these effects an aiming strategy optimization approach is presented by combining a multi objective genetic algorithm ga and monte carlo ray tracing to homogenize the flux distribution in current work both the flux non uniformity index and the optical loss ηloss are used as the objective functions based on the approach first the flux distributions in the multi tube cavity receiver mtcr and the single tube receiver with a secondary collector strsc are optimized at a typical condition optimal results indicate that the ga optimization strategy s2 can reach a compromise between the flux non uniformity and the optical loss in both mtcr and strsc systems furthermore the optimal strategy obtained at a specific transversal incidence angle can be applied in a relatively large range around it moreover parameter study indicates that the aiming line number naim has little impact on the efficiencies of the  systems naim has almost no effect on the flux non uniformity in the mtcr but the effect is visible in the strsc finally the application of s2 under a real time condition indicates that fluxes in the  receivers can be homogenized efficaciously in the whole time range with a small drop of 0 2 3 8 percentage points in efficiency compared with those of traditional  line aiming strategy s1 it is also found that the flux non uniformity indexes of the mtcr are greatly reduced from 0 77 1 09 to 0 02 0 06 when s1 is replaced by s2 and those of the strsc are steeply reduced from 0 59 0 70 to 0 29 0 37 it is concluded that the present approach is effective and suitable for homogenizing the fluxes in the receivers of lfrs     a novel single shear specimen sss together with a correction coefficient method is  to study the deformation behavior of a 304 stainless steel under shear loadings shear stress shear strain relations over a wide range of shear strain rates 0 001 to 39000 s 1 at three initial temperatures 77 to 473 k are obtained experimentally the effects of strain rate and temperature on the flow stress curves are determined with increasing strain rate or temperature the strain hardening rate decreases continuously at the maximum strain rate of 39000 s 1 negative strain hardening rates are observed at very high strain rates above 13000 s 1 a sharp increase in flow stress is observed indicating a rapid rise in strain rate sensitivity the fracture morphology of post mortem specimens is analyzed and no well developed adiabatic shear bands are observed this may be due to the shear tension stress state without hydrostatic pressure in the fracture process based on the experimentally obtained shear stress shear strain curves parameters of a modified johnson cook mjc model are determined a good agreement between experiments and model predictions is found with an average error of 3 9  finite element analysis distributions of stress and strain compnts in the specimen shear z is analyzed it is found that the shear stress and shear strain play dominant roles and a simple shear stress state with low stress triaxiality 0 015 and lode angle parameter 0 014 is obtained    purpose currently four dimensional 4d c beam computed tomography cbct requires a 3 4 min full fan scan to ensure usable image quality recent advancements in sparse view 4d cbct reconstruction have opened the possibility to reduce scan time and dose the aim of this study is to provide a common framework for systematically evaluating algorithms for 4d cbct reconstruction from a 1 min scan  this framework the aapm sponsored spare challenge was conducted in 2018 to identify and compare state of the art algorithms methods a clinically realistic cbct dataset was simulated  patient ct volumes from the 4d lung database the selected patients had multiple 4d ct sessions where the first 4d ct was  as the prior ct and the rest were  as the ground truth volumes for simulating cbct projections a gpu based monte carlo tool was  to simulate the primary scatter and quantum noise signals a total of 32 cbct scans of nine patients were generated additional qualitative analysis was performed on a clinical varian and clinical elekta dataset to validate the simulation study participants were blinded from the ground truth and were given 3 months to apply their reconstruction algorithms to the projection data the submitted reconstructions were analyzed in terms of root mean squared error rmse and structural similarity index ssim with the ground truth within four different region of interests roi patient body lungs planning target volume ptv and bony anatomy geometric accuracy was quantified as the alignment error of the ptv results twenty teams participated in the challenge with five teams completing the challenge techniques involved in the five methods included iterative optimization motion compensation and deformation of the prior 4d ct all five methods rendered significant reduction in noise and streaking artifacts when compared to the conventional feldkamp davis kress fdk algorithm the rms of the three dimensional 3d target registration error of the five methods ranged from 1 79 to 3 00 mm qualitative observations from the varian and elekta datasets mostly concur with those from the simulation dataset each of the methods was found to have its own strengths and weaknesses overall the ma rooster method which utilizes a 4d ct motion model for temporal reg ularization had the best and most consistent image quality and accuracy conclusion the spare challenge represents the first framework for systematically evaluating state of the art algorithms for 4d cbct reconstruction from a 1 min scan results suggest the potential for reducing scan time and dose for 4d cbct the challenge dataset and analysis framework are publicly available for benchmarking

installed manufacturing lines most of the available working space is often used and adding a new serial robot on the workshop ground is sometimes difficult  the ceiling to fix heavy machines is not always possible and it could be necessary to reinforce the structure cdpr is a way to achieve the work with a light structure with low modification of the existing workshop the novelty of the work lies in the fact that the majority of the existing designs place the actuating motors and the winches on the base platform whereas in this work the actuating motors are placed on the moving platform making it convenient for the cdpr to be fixed in the manufacturing line with simple anchor points first the workspace of the cdpr for the desired environment is investigated the underactuated nature of the robot and the positive cable tension constraint imposed due to the flexibility of the cable limit the workspace investigation to static equilibrium conditions the classical static equilibrium equations have been used to calculate the robot workspace and the corresponding behavior of the plat form orientation angles have been presented several case studies have been shown with different payloads attached to the moving platform the dimensions of the moving platform and the base structure have also been changed to understand the possible region of the workspace where the robot performance can be satisfactory the prototype dimensions have been fixed taking into account the workspace performance following this the classical dynamic model developed in the field of cdpr has been used to implement the control law on the cdpr the second part of the thesis presents the design and implementation of the control laws for the cdpr the classical input output feedback linearization iofl technique is developed and simulation results have been presented the role of internal dynamics present in the system because of the underactuation is demonstrated  their phase plane plots  possible solutions have been suggested to reduce the effect of internal dynamics on the system the first solution is to use appropriate dimensions for the platform and the base structure simulation results have been presented to show the behavior of the platform when the dimensions are changed a modified feedback linearization mfl has been  as an ad hoc solution for eliminating the effects of the internal dynamics the simulation results obtained show that the  ad hoc solution performs efficiently and significantly better than the classical iofl technique for certain dimensions of the cdpr the use of this approach for different cases of cdpr needs to be investigated experimental results validating the iofl technique are presented to demonstrate the satisfactory behavior of the cdpr with the control law developed during the thesis the overall objective of the project is to develop a cdpr that can work with an operator in a fully functional manufacturing line and aid the worker in lifting heavy or hot objects this thesis achieves the first step in making a functional prototype of a cdpr which will be improved further to make it collaborative    while mass production

particle correlation matrix from heavy ion collisions the analysis uses data from snn 2 76tev pbpb and snn 5 02tev ppb collisions collected by the cms experiment at the cern large hadron collider  particle azimuthal correlations have been extensively used to study hydrodynamic flow in heavy ion collisions recently it was shown that the expected factorization of  particle results into a product of the constituent single particle anisotropies is broken the new information provided by these modes may shed light on the breakdown of flow factorization in heavy ion collisions the first  modes leading and subleading of  particle correlations are presented for elliptical and triangular anisotropies in pbpb and ppb collisions as a function of pt over a wide range of event activity the leading mode is found to be essentially equivalent to the anisotropy harmonic previously extracted from  particle correlation methods the subleading mode represents a new experimental observable and is shown to account for a large fraction of the factorization breaking recently observed at high transverse momentum the principle compnt analysis technique was also applied to multiplicity fluctuations these

the invariant mass of oppositely charged lepton pairs are  to distinguish the signal from the standard model background the observations are consistent with the expectations from standard model

scrap repair and the penalty of shipped defective items and maximize system productivity notably the system productivity is formulized as a non linear measure and then it is linearized by the piecewise linear approximation technique in addition the uncertainty about the estimation of cost compnts and demand is handled by a robust possibilistic approach a numerical example and a real case study are investigated to validate and verify the proposed models the most important result of this research is that the determination of inspection locations along a manufacturing line in different periods of time regarding the impact of preventive maintenance activities on defective production probability results in a more efficient system    the choice of an adapted production system is essential in today s volatile market environment for this choice the identification of common and distinct assemblies in between the product variants is of high importance this  presents four new similarity indices which are aggregated to categorize products the categorization will support the choice of an assembly system type dedicated reconfigurable or hybrid for a selection of product subassemblies when designing a new production facility on this way operational areas for a reconfigurable system can be defined the novel approach is applied to an industrial case study in automotive industry    an increased and ongoing trend to more product variety can be observed in manufacturing industries this trend implies that enterprises have to deal with more and more differing products which leads to challenges on both sides the product design and the production the improvement of production being an important factor the challenge on the side of the design department is not minor between design for manufacturing assembly and increasing demands in terms of customisation the management of highly varying products and the generation of coherent product families is of great importance this article presents a new design improvement methodology based on  physical and functional architecture similarity indices and  assembly technology similarity indices it aims to guide the designer in the analysis of product similarity the identification of product subassemblies to optimise and the choice of consistent assembly solutions for an easier product family generation and optimised production a case study from automotive industry is presented to illustrate the application of this approach    the focus of this research work is on proposing a joint analysis of product design and assembly process that analyses the product similarity in terms of design and assembly technology similarity to group them into families for these product families a new architectural design approach for their assembly system is presented based on compnts used to locate subassemblies during the assembly operations it allows the production system to be redesigned based on locating sequences locating scheduling and compatible locating schemes for a multi product assembly this approach is used to design reconfigurable production systems and to identify relevant opportunities for new multi product systems the  method is evaluated by case studies in cooperation with the industrial partner     current sampling of genomic sequence data from eukaryotes is relatively poor biased and inadequate to address important questions about their biology evolution and ecology this community page describes a resource of 700 transcriptomes from marine microbial eukaryotes to help understand their role in the world s oceans    large strain hardening is the main material description ingredient for cold bulk forming process simulations hardening identification of large strains is a trade off between cost standardization and the ability to represent the experiment but there are no standard procedures to date in this  approach large strains larger than 1 are reached  an industrial wire drawing process and measured data for identification are obtained from standard tensile tests fast semi analytical post processing was possible despite the significant process inherited strain heterogeneity the parameters of state of the art hardening models were identified and the robustness was demonstrated to reach far beyond the strain level attained in the experiments as a consequence accurate and robust large strain hardening modelling was achieved from standard tensile test acquisition by  industrial wire drawing pre strains    the main objective of this thesis is to identify the parameters of a hot metal rheology model by  experimental data from an industrial press in the first chapter the principle of parameter identification is exposed uniaxial compression testing d on specialized devices serves as a case study the notions of cost function experimental design and rheological model are examined a sensitivity analysis is also performed the next chapter present the experimental tools  on the industrial press finally the friction and thermal exchange that will happen during the tests are evaluated the third chapter is about the inverse analysis on industrial press finite elements modelling of the compression is made and compared with the experiments the identification results are then compared with the forge software database and the material parameters found in chapter 1 a complex part is then simulated with these different parameters and compared with a real forging of this part the fourth chapter uses the same methods as in chapter 3 to perform an identification on the rheological parameters of an incl 625 a microstructural model for the incl is then identified with industrial testing as reference      in sheet metal forming process the material usually undergoes large deformations complex loading histories and its mechanical behavior can be modeled by constitutive equations despite the great efforts paid to develop advanced hardening models considering the bauschinger effect the reliability and applicability of the developed hardening models still needs to be investigated both experimentally and theoretically in the first part based on the developed hardening models some classical and advanced models are selected are implemented by  euler explicit implementation method after that the developed numerical instruments in current work are applied to investigate the prediction of the yield surface evolution which show that some apparent violation of the normality condition can be simulated  models based on associated plasticity the second part mainly focuses on characterizing and discriminating for selecting material models firstly some characterizations tests including complex loading path are performed to identify material parameters and bending under tension discriminant test is built to investing springback behavior that can sort out the best model     in the current era of increased customization changing manufacturing systems and business globalization effective use of product design information and knowledge generated from the product model can facilitate the decision making of an assembly sequence by providing feasible product relationships and a viable semantic foundation in order to enrich such semantics a geometry enhanced on tology modelling and reasoning framework is  in this  to explicitly express relevant concepts for assembly sequence planning asp a rule based reasoning mechanism based on ontology web language description logics owl dl and semantic web rule language swrl is also suggested to clarify implicit relations by incorporating reasoning units rus to process complex geometric information this framework is then validated with a case study related to assembly sequence planning    market dynamics of today are constantly evolving in the presence of emerging technologies such as additive manufacturing am drivers such as mass customization strategies high part complexity needs shorter prod uct development cycles a large pool of materials to choose from abundant manufacturing processes diverse streams of applications e g aerospace motor vehicles and health care and high cost incurred due to manufac turability of the part have made it essential to choose the right compromise of materials manufacturing processes and associated machines in early stages of design considering the design for additive manufacturing guidelines there exists a complex relationship between am products and their process data however the literature to date shows very less studies targeting this integration as several criteria material attributes and process function ality requirements are involved for decision making in the industries this  introduces a generic decision methodology based on multi criteria decision making tools that will not only provide a set of compromised am materials processes and machines but will also act as a guideline for designers to achieve a strong foothold in the am industry by providing practical solutions containing design oriented and feasible material machine com binations from a current database of 38 renowned am vendors in the world an industrial case study related to aerospace has also been tested in detail via the  methodology     reconfigurable manufacturing systems constitute a new manufacturing paradigm and are considered as the future of manufacturing because of their changeable and flexible nature in a reconfigurable manufacturing environment basic modules can be rearranged interchanged or modified to adjust the production capacity according to production requirements reconfigurable machine tools have modular structure comprising of basic and auxiliary modules that aid in modifying the functionality of a manufacturing system as the product s design and its manufacturing capabilities are closely related the manufacturing system is desired to be customizable to cater for all the design changes moreover the performance of a manufacturing system lies in a set of planning and scheduling data incorporated with the machining capabilities keeping in view the market demands this research work is based on the co evolution of process planning and machine configurations in which optimal machine capabilities are generated through the application of multi objective genetic algorithms furthermore based on these capabilities the system is tested for reconfiguration in case of production changeovers since in a reconfigurable environment the same machine can be  to perform different tasks depending on the required configuration the subject research work assigns optimum number of machines by minimizing the machining capabilities to carry out different operations in order to streamline production responses an algorithm has also been developed and verified on a part family as a result of the  methodology an optimized reconfigurable framework can be achieved to realize optimal production of a part family finally the  methodology was applied on a case study and respective conclusions were drawn    the doctoral research focuses to build an integrated approach that can simultaneously handle the product and process parameters related to additive manufacturing am since market dynamics of today are constantly evolving drivers such as mass customization strategies shorter product development cycles a large pool of materials to choose from abundant manufacturing processes etc have made it essential to choose the right compromise of materials manufacturing processes and associated machines in early stages of design considering the design for am guidelines as several criteria material attributes and process functionality requirements are involved for decision making in the industries the thesis introduces a generic decision methodology based on multi criteria decision making tools that can not only provide a set of compromised am materials processes and machines but will also act as a guideline for designers to achieve a strong foothold in the am industry by providing practical solutions containing design oriented and feasible material machine combinations from a database of 38 renowned am vendors in the world today '"
