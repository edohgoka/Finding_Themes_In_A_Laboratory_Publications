# Finding_Themes_In_A_Laboratory_Publications

The goal of this project is to make sense of unstructured data. These latter represent the abstracts of the laboratory publications. By analyzing these abstracts, we can find the research or departments of research in that laboratory. To do this, following steps have been followed:
- Scraping the abstracts dataset
- Pre-processing the dataset
- Applying the Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) algorithm to find topics in the dataset
- Visualizing the results
